# Lumina Marketing App

Status: Verified.

This is the first Lumina marketing website source fixture. It exists so the compiler and CLI can
exercise a real app-shaped route tree through route discovery, CLI inspection, minimal dev serving,
static build output, and static built-output serving.

The public pages use a local shadcn-style source component layer under `components/ui/`, a
`components.json` file for future shadcn CLI additions, and a Tailwind v4 entry file at
`app/globals.css`. The current Lumina renderer still inlines the app-owned CSS from `styles.ts` so
the fixture can prove the marketing and docs surface without changing Lumina's broader CSS delivery
contract.

The root layout supports light and dark mode through shadcn-style CSS variables, the `dark` class on
`html`, a header theme toggle, and `localStorage` persistence under `lumina-theme`. The inline CSS
path and `app/globals.css` should stay aligned until Lumina implements direct CSS asset delivery for
the app renderer.

The docs area is a public-docs route scaffold inspired by documentation systems such as Next.js: it
has a docs home, lane pages, topic pages, source-path cards, reference lanes, active sidebar
navigation, status language, an SSR `/docs/search` route backed by a bundled docs index, and an SSR
`/docs/*` inventory viewer backed by metadata for the current `docs/public/` page set. The catch-all
route now renders a bundled Markdown body snapshot for mapped public docs pages, and docs pages use a
complete in-app public-docs inventory sidebar grouped by lane. It is not yet a frontmatter parser,
generated sidebar artifact, generated static docs router, generated search artifact, or
machine-readable docs output.

## Routes

- `/`
- `/about`
- `/docs`
- `/docs/start`
- `/docs/concepts`
- `/docs/concepts/app-graph`
- `/docs/guides`
- `/docs/guides/create-app`
- `/docs/reference`
- `/docs/reference/cli`
- `/docs/reference/routing`
- `/docs/reference/manifest-contracts`
- `/docs/search`
- `/docs/deployment`
- `/docs/community`
- `/docs/*` for Markdown-backed public-doc inventory pages
- `/benchmarks`
- `/examples`
- `/roadmap`

## Current Verification

From the repository root:

```bash
bun run lumina -- routes apps/www --json
bun run lumina -- inspect apps/www --json
bun run lumina -- inspect apps/www why /
bun run lumina -- dev apps/www --once
bun run lumina -- build apps/www --json
bun run lumina -- start apps/www --once
```

These commands generate and inspect:

- `.lumina/routes.json`
- `.lumina/render-manifest.json`
- `.lumina/map.json`
- `.lumina/build-trace.json`
- `.lumina/perf.report.json`
- `dist/routes.manifest.json`
- `dist/render.manifest.json`
- `dist/adapter.manifest.json`
- `dist/public/*.html`

## Known Limitations

- Hydration is currently proven for the root marketing route and counter fixture, not for a complete
  application interaction model.
- Component-level HMR is not implemented yet.
- Production SSR/API serving is not implemented yet.
- Benchmark pages describe status only and make no performance claims.
