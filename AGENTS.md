# AGENTS.md

This file is the operating guide for AI agents working in this repository.

Agents must read this file before editing code or documentation. When the project changes in a way that affects setup, commands, architecture, package boundaries, roadmap, or safety rules, agents must update this file and README.md in the same change.

## Project Identity

Project name: Lumina.

Lumina is an app-graph-native, SEO-first React framework for humans and AI agents. It uses Bun for package management, local workflow, testing, and the default adapter path; Vite/Rolldown for frontend build leverage; and a custom Lumina compiler for route intelligence, SEO, graph, API generation, and agent context.

## Current Phase

Current phase: Phase 1, monorepo scaffold.

The repository currently contains documentation, a Bun workspace scaffold, package placeholders, contract-backed shared core model types, initial `@lumina/compiler` route discovery and route manifest shaping, MVP Bun `lumina.config.ts` parsing and diagnostics, scaffolded `apps/www` with an SSR public-docs search route, Markdown-backed docs viewer, deterministic public docs preview artifacts, a verified `examples/basic` starter fixture, a runnable `examples/blog-seo` content fixture, runnable generated large-route fixtures for route/render/map artifact evidence, a scaffolded multi-app workspace fixture, CI, and enforcement scripts. Do not invent implemented framework behavior in docs unless the implementation exists or the text clearly marks it as planned.

The next prototype target is defined in `docs/mvp-alpha-scope.md`. Agents must keep MVP Alpha scope language aligned with README.md, this file, status, roadmap, getting started, examples, file conventions, and Lumina Map docs.

## Setup

Implemented repository commands:

```bash
bun install
bun test
bun run test:browser
bun run typecheck
bun run docs:check
bun run lumina -- routes <appPath> --json
bun run lumina -- inspect <appPath> --json
bun run lumina -- inspect <appPath> why <route>
bun run lumina -- map affected <appPath> <file> --json
bun run lumina -- dev <appPath>
bun run lumina -- dev <appPath> --once
bun run lumina -- build <appPath>
bun run lumina -- build <appPath> --json
bun run lumina -- start <appPath>
bun run lumina -- start <appPath> --once
bun run lumina -- bench --list --json
bun run lumina -- bench <name> --json
bun run lumina -- bench route-discovery --json --run
bun run lumina -- bench manifest-size --json --run
bun run lumina -- bench graph-query --json --run
bun run lumina -- bench adapter-dispatch --json --run
bun run structure:check
bun run performance:check
bun run check
```

`lumina dev` uses the selected port strictly. If the default local port is already in use, rerun with `bun run lumina -- dev <appPath> --port <port>` instead of expecting automatic port fallback.

These commands verify the scaffold, docs links, root docs metadata, docs navigation coverage, package-map/build-plan/backlog alignment, planned CLI command surface and prefix consistency, status-drift guardrails, config/adapter contract terms, generated artifact inventories across agent and machine-readable docs, package structure, shared-core type ownership, shared-core contract terminology, performance documentation guardrails, TypeScript surface, route-discovery fixture behavior, explicit `staticPage()` / `ssr()` render-mode extraction, MVP Bun `lumina.config.ts` parsing and diagnostics, generated `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json`, direct local import map edges, `.lumina/client/*.js` dev hydration bundles, browser-verified interactive dev and production hydration, `.lumina/hmr-report.json` route-file and direct local imported component affected-route reports, `.lumina/generated/server-entry.ts`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, `dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js`, `dist/public/docs-index.json`, `dist/public/docs-navigation.json`, `dist/public/llms.txt`, `dist/public/llms-full.txt`, `dist/server/ssr-routes.js`, `dist/routes.manifest.json`, `dist/render.manifest.json`, and `dist/adapter.manifest.json` output, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, `lumina map affected --json`, `lumina bench --list --json`, `lumina bench <name> --json`, `lumina bench route-discovery --json --run`, `lumina bench manifest-size --json --run`, `lumina bench graph-query --json --run`, `lumina bench adapter-dispatch --json --run`, minimal `lumina dev` timed startup output and Vite SSR route serving for static, dynamic, and catch-all page routes with page `params`, `searchParams`, not-found components, and error components, `virtual:lumina/routes`, static `lumina build` with timed human phase output, static `lumina start` through `@lumina/adapter-bun` with request-path guardrails, static HTML and client asset cache-header assertions, public `.json` and `.txt` asset content types, generated SSR route serving including public docs search and Markdown-backed docs inventory routes, stable 404s, sanitized malformed-path responses, sanitized production SSR 500 responses, verified `examples/basic` dev/build/start evidence, scaffolded `apps/www` route evidence, generated large-route fixture source/artifact evidence, early benchmark/status skeleton paths, route-discovery, manifest-size, graph-query, and adapter-dispatch local raw metadata output, and tests. They do not prove persisted benchmark result files, reviewed public benchmark evidence, API production behavior, broader component-level browser HMR, broader Lumina Map query modes, MCP tools, or safe edits.

## Planned Commands

```bash
lumina dev
lumina build
lumina start
lumina routes
lumina inspect
lumina check
lumina test
lumina seo
lumina map
lumina workspace
lumina agent
lumina mcp
lumina edit
lumina migrate
lumina bench
```

## Repository Rules

- Prefer deterministic compiler output.
- Follow `docs/engineering-standards.md` for definitions of ready, done, review quality, ownership, and evidence.
- Prefer AST edits over string replacement for TypeScript source.
- Add or update tests for every implemented feature.
- Keep production runtime free of agent metadata.
- Keep CLI JSON output stable, compact, and documented.
- Public SEO behavior must be tested when implemented.
- New graph edges must include `kind`, `source`, `confidence`, and `why`.
- Claims about scaffolded directories, examples, commands, generated files, and performance evidence must match the current filesystem and checks; otherwise mark them as planned.
- MVP Alpha docs and implementation must keep route discovery, basic render modes, Lumina Map output, CLI inspection, and the demo app as the center. Do not pull MCP, safe edits, API routes, migration, or benchmark claims into MVP Alpha unless the scope doc is updated in the same change.
- Shared core model types belong in `@lumina/core`; other packages must import them instead of defining local `LuminaApp`, `RouteNode`, `GraphEdge`, `LuminaDiagnostic`, `RenderMode`, `CachePlan`, or `AdapterManifest` substitutes.
- Docs that describe planned expansions of shared core model types must also state the current contract-backed shape and add or preserve an automated docs guardrail when drift would mislead readers.
- Do not edit generated files manually.
- Do not add network calls in tests unless explicitly required.
- Do not introduce global mutable state in the server runtime.
- Do not implement a custom bundler before the Vite/Rolldown path is proven.
- Do not make React Server Components the default render path before stable SSR, SSG, streaming, and the route compiler exist.
- Do not let Lumina Map be the only source of truth for safety-critical decisions.
- Treat missing semantic contracts as low-confidence graph data instead of guessing.
- Safe edits must be AST-based, previewable, logged, check-backed, and reversible.
- User application code should not require Bun-only APIs; Bun-specific behavior belongs inside runtime adapter packages.

## Generated Files

Planned generated files include:

```txt
.lumina/routes.json
.lumina/render-manifest.json
.lumina/map.json
.lumina/graph.json
.lumina/seo.report.json
.lumina/perf.report.json
.lumina/workspace.json
.lumina/workspace-graph.json
.lumina/affected.json
.lumina/build-trace.json
.lumina/cache-report.json
.lumina/hmr-report.json
.lumina/split-report.json
.lumina/context/*.ctx.json
.lumina/context/agent-index.json
.lumina/mutations.json
.lumina/client/*.js
.lumina/generated/*
.lumina/generated/server-entry.ts
.lumina/generated/client/*.tsx
dist/routes.manifest.json
dist/render.manifest.json
dist/seo.report.json
dist/adapter.manifest.json
dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js
dist/public/docs-index.json
dist/public/docs-navigation.json
dist/public/llms.txt
dist/public/llms-full.txt
dist/*
```

Rules:

- Generated files must identify their source inputs when practical.
- Generated files must be reproducible across operating systems.
- Generated files must not require manual edits.
- Agent metadata must not be shipped in production runtime bundles.

## Safety

High-risk areas:

- Auth and sessions.
- Billing or payment integrations.
- Cache invalidation.
- Deployment adapters.
- File-system write tools.
- Safe edit APIs.
- MCP write tools.
- Environment variable handling.
- Runtime request routing.

## Risk Mitigation Rules

Agents must read `docs/risk-mitigation.md` before changing Lumina Map, Agent Kernel, MCP, runtime adapters, or safe edit behavior.

Key rules:

- Build semantic graph extraction in layers: file graph, explicit contracts, convention inference, then optional static analysis.
- Prefer explicit `.contract.ts` files for high-confidence semantic edges.
- Every `GraphEdge` must include `kind`, `source`, `confidence`, and `why`.
- Keep the first working slice scoped to create app, SEO-safe pages, `@lumina/adapter-bun` serving, basic map, agent inspection, and safe metadata edit.
- Treat `docs/prototype-acceptance.md`, README, and the public roadmap as the broader first public prototype acceptance scope.
- Move Node adapter work earlier than the long-term adapter phase to reduce Bun adoption friction.
- Keep adapter boundaries early: Bun-specific APIs stay in `@lumina/adapter-bun`, Node compatibility stays in `@lumina/adapter-node`, and static export logic stays in `@lumina/adapter-static`.
- Safe edit transactions must validate, produce a dry-run preview, apply through AST, format, regenerate graph, run affected checks, log to `.lumina/mutations.json`, and support undo.
- High-risk safe edits in production workflows require explicit human sign-off.
- New feature work must pass the scope gate: improves map or agent experience, adds minimal production runtime code, and has a clear fixture or agent demo.

Agents must treat high-risk changes as requiring stronger tests and clearer documentation.

## Architecture Principles

1. Static-first, SSR when needed, client-only only when intentional.
2. Agent-safe, human-auditable.
3. Compiler intelligence over runtime magic.
4. Typed route graph is the app contract.
5. SEO must pass by default for public pages.
6. Hot APIs bypass React.
7. Every generated artifact has a source and explanation.
8. Large apps are not an afterthought.
9. Production bundles do not ship agent metadata.
10. No invisible caching.

## Learning and Collaboration

This project was initially explored with AI assistance for architecture and roadmap clarity. Human maintainers remain accountable for implementation, review, and release decisions. Agents may contribute work only through the same documented contracts, tests, and safety rules as human contributors.

Contributors, human or agent, are expected to:

- Ask clarifying questions when uncertain.
- Document tradeoffs and rejected approaches.
- Update this file and relevant docs when patterns change.
- Keep planned behavior separate from implemented behavior.
- Prefer learning-in-public notes that improve the next contributor's context.

## Package Boundaries

Planned package responsibilities are documented in `docs/package-map.md`.

Do not add cross-package imports casually. Shared types belong in `@lumina/core`. Compiler-only code belongs in `@lumina/compiler`. Runtime request handling belongs in runtime adapters, starting with `@lumina/adapter-bun`. Agent and MCP code must remain dev/build-time unless explicitly designed as a development server feature.

Phase 1 package scaffolding must follow `docs/phase-1-build-plan.md`. The active runtime adapter package names are `@lumina/adapter-bun`, `@lumina/adapter-node`, and `@lumina/adapter-static`. Reintroduce any separate `@lumina/server-bun` package only through an architecture decision record.

## Testing Expectations

For implemented features, use the smallest complete test set that proves behavior:

- Unit tests for pure parsing, manifest, schema, and graph logic.
- Integration tests for CLI behavior and fixture apps.
- HTTP tests for server runtime behavior.
- Snapshot or stable JSON tests for agent-facing output.
- Fixture tests for route discovery, SEO, API routes, and map generation.

Test output used by agents must be deterministic.

## Agent Workflow

Before editing:

1. Read `README.md`.
2. Read this `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read the relevant docs under `docs/`.
4. Check whether the task is documentation-only, scaffolding, implementation, or verification.
5. Read `docs/engineering-standards.md` for non-trivial implementation, architecture, or process work.
6. Read `docs/review-checklist.md` before preparing non-trivial work for review.
7. Read `docs/agent-enforcement.md` for non-trivial docs, structure, performance, package-boundary, status, or verification work.
8. For AI collaboration or delegation changes, read `docs/skills/README.md` and `docs/subagents/README.md`.
9. For MVP Alpha agent workflow, read `docs/alpha-agent-operating-system.md`, `docs/alpha-work-routing.md`, and `docs/alpha-drift-prevention.md`.
10. For Phase 1 scaffolding or package-boundary work, read `docs/phase-1-build-plan.md`.

While editing:

1. Keep changes scoped.
2. Update docs touched by the change.
3. Prefer adding task files from `docs/templates/task-template.md` for implementation work.
4. Keep docs-level skills and subagent role briefs vendor-neutral and aligned with the documented safety rules.
5. Keep Claude, Codex, Cursor, and future tool-specific wrappers thin; source behavior belongs in `docs/skills/`, `docs/subagents/`, and the Alpha operating docs.
6. Keep planned, scaffolded, implemented, and verified behavior separate.
7. When a doc names a directory or example as current, confirm it exists or make the text explicitly planned.

Before finishing:

1. Run available checks.
2. If checks cannot run, state the exact command and reason.
3. Verify `README.md` and `AGENTS.md` still describe the repository honestly.
4. Apply `docs/docs-freshness-policy.md`, `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`, and `docs/docs-verification.md`.
5. Summarize changed files and remaining next steps.
