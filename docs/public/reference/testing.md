# Testing

Status: Planned.

Audience: app developers, contributors, AI agents.

Lumina testing is planned around deterministic fixtures, stable JSON snapshots, HTTP adapter checks, browser checks for user-visible behavior, and explicit evidence reporting. Initial scaffold checks exist; feature-specific test tooling is still planned.

## Scaffold Commands

```bash
bun test
bun run typecheck
bun run docs:check
bun run structure:check
bun run performance:check
bun run check
```

These commands are verified for the Phase 1 scaffold. They prove scaffold integrity, documentation links and guardrails, package structure, performance documentation hygiene, TypeScript validity, scaffold tests, and shared core model tests. They do not prove route discovery, rendering, runtime adapter behavior, Lumina Map generation, MCP tools, or safe edits.

## Future Target Commands

```bash
bun run test:fixtures
bun run test:http
bun run test:browser
```

Fixture, HTTP, and browser commands are target commands until implementation lands.

## Planned Test Layers

- Unit tests.
- Fixture tests.
- Snapshot tests.
- Integration tests.
- HTTP tests.
- Browser tests.
- Security tests.
- Performance tests only when benchmark methodology applies.

## Rules

- Generated JSON snapshots must be deterministic.
- Fixture output must avoid absolute local paths and machine-specific data.
- Snapshot updates must be explicit and reviewed.
- External network calls are not allowed by default.
- Browser tests should cover real user-visible behavior, not component internals.
