# Project Structure

Status: Planned.

Audience: app developers, framework contributors, AI agents.

NeedleStart apps are planned to use a small application root, file-based routes under `app/`, generated framework artifacts under `.needle/`, and production output under `dist/`.

The repository is in Phase 1 scaffold. This page describes target application structure and scaffolded repository structure, not verified generated app output.

## Application Structure

Planned generated app:

```txt
my-app/
  app/
    layout.tsx
    page.tsx
    api/
      health.ts
  needle.config.ts
  package.json
  public/
```

| Path | Purpose | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/` | Route modules, layouts, pages, route handlers, and route-level conventions. | Planned |
| `app/page.tsx` | Home page route. | Planned |
| `app/layout.tsx` | Root layout for nested pages. | Planned |
| `app/api/*` | API route handlers. | Planned |
| `needle.config.ts` | Framework config. | Planned |
| `public/` | Static assets copied to output. | Planned |
| `.needle/` | Generated route, render, SEO, graph, and agent artifacts. | Planned |
| `dist/` | Built production output. | Planned |

## Generated Files

Planned generated files:

```txt
.needle/
  routes.json
  render-manifest.json
  map.json
  graph.json
  seo.report.json
  perf.report.json
  context/
    agent-index.json
  generated/
dist/
```

The canonical generated artifact names are `.needle/routes.json`, `.needle/render-manifest.json`, `.needle/map.json`, `.needle/graph.json`, `.needle/seo.report.json`, `.needle/perf.report.json`, `.needle/context/*.ctx.json`, `.needle/context/agent-index.json`, `.needle/generated/*`, and `dist/adapter.manifest.json`.

Generated files must be deterministic and must not be edited manually.

## Repository Structure

NeedleStart itself is scaffolded as a Bun workspace with packages under `packages/`, adapter packages under `packages/adapters/`, examples under `examples/`, tests under `tests/`, and documentation under `docs/`.

Planned test fixture structure is defined in [Testing](testing.md) and the internal [Testing Contract](../../testing-contract.md).

Root-level AI collaboration playbooks should not exist. The canonical skill and subagent briefs live under:

```txt
docs/
  skills/
  subagents/
```
