# CLI Reference

Status: Planned.

Audience: app developers, AI agents.

The `@needle/cli` package is scaffolded, but no NeedleStart CLI command behavior exists yet. This page is the public-facing reference home for planned commands.

| Planned command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `needle dev` | Start local development. |
| `needle build` | Build app output and generated artifacts. |
| `needle start` | Start a built app. |
| `needle routes` | Inspect discovered routes. |
| `needle inspect` | Inspect a route, file, or generated artifact. |
| `needle check` | Run framework-aware checks. |
| `needle seo` | Run SEO audits. |
| `needle map` | Query Needle Map. |
| `needle agent` | Generate or inspect agent context. |
| `needle mcp` | Start MCP server. |
| `needle edit` | Preview, apply, inspect, and undo safe-edit transactions. |
| `needle migrate` | Prototype migration workflows. |
| `needle bench` | Run benchmark fixtures and emit evidence metadata. |

Exact options, outputs, and exit codes will be documented after implementation.

## Planned Command Variants

These variants are referenced by public guides, roadmap, and internal contracts:

```txt
needle inspect why
needle map route
needle map affected
needle map explain
needle agent init
needle agent context
needle agent task
needle agent plan
needle agent apply
needle agent log
needle edit undo
needle migrate from-next
needle seo --route
needle seo --sitemap
needle seo --strict
```

## Planned JSON Automation Surface

Commands that agents, scripts, or CI should consume need stable `--json` output once implemented. The initial planned JSON command surfaces are:

```txt
needle build --json
needle routes --json
needle inspect --json
needle check --json
needle seo --json
needle map --json
needle agent context --json
needle edit --json
needle migrate --json
needle bench --json
```

These JSON outputs are planned, not implemented. The shared envelope, diagnostic shape, exit-code policy, and stability rules live in [CLI JSON Contract](../../cli-json-contract.md).
