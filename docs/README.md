- Keep `README.md` concise and user-facing.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` operational for AI agents.
- Keep deep design details in `docs/`.
- Mark planned features as planned.
- Mark implemented features as implemented only after verification.
- Update roadmap status when implementation begins or scope changes.
- Prefer examples that can later become tests.
