# MVP Alpha Scope

Status: Planned.
Audience: maintainers, framework contributors, AI agents, early prototype users.

This page defines the first Lumina MVP Alpha target. It is a target scope, not a claim that framework behavior exists today.

## Current Evidence

The repository currently has the Phase 1 scaffold: Bun workspace, package placeholders, shared `@lumina/core` scaffold types, `@lumina/react` `staticPage()` / `ssr()` helpers, `@lumina/compiler` route discovery and explicit static/SSR render-mode extraction, generated `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json` output with direct local import edges, `.lumina/client/*.js` dev hydration bundle output, `dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js` production hydration bundle output, browser-verified interactive dev and production root-route hydration, `.lumina/hmr-report.json`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, and `.lumina/perf.report.json` output, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, minimal `lumina map affected --json`, `lumina bench --list --json`, minimal `lumina dev` Vite SSR route serving with dynamic and catch-all page route params plus search params and not-found/error components, `virtual:lumina/routes`, static `lumina build`, static `lumina start`, scaffolded `apps/www`, verified `examples/basic` starter evidence, runnable `examples/blog-seo` content evidence, scaffolded example source fixtures, CI, and verification scripts. It does not yet have component-level HMR, production SSR/API serving, benchmark execution commands, or broader Lumina Map query CLI behavior.

## MVP Alpha Goal

MVP Alpha should prove that a small React app can be created, discovered, rendered, mapped, inspected, and explained through Lumina's compiler and CLI.

## Included In MVP Alpha

- Create a demo app from the workspace or `bun create lumina` target flow.
- Discover file-based routes from `app/`.
- Support a root layout and basic pages.
- Support explicit render modes for `staticPage()` and a minimal SSR mode.
- Generate `.lumina/routes.json`.
- Generate `.lumina/render-manifest.json`.
- Generate `.lumina/map.json` as the first Lumina Map output.
- Expose `lumina routes --json`.
- Expose `lumina inspect --json`.
- Expose `lumina inspect why`.
- Expose a minimal `lumina map affected --json` route-impact query for direct local imports.
- Expose `lumina bench --list --json` for honest benchmark skeleton status without running benchmarks.
- Include a demo app that shows the Lumina Map and inspection workflow.
- Keep JSON output deterministic and compact.
- Add the early benchmark and fixture skeleton with `not implemented` status only, so later speed work has stable paths before public claims exist.
- Document the large-repo workspace graph lane before route discovery expands, without implementing multi-app runtime behavior in MVP Alpha.

## Deferred Until After MVP Alpha

- API routes.
- Hot API schemas.
- Full SEO engine.
- Full cache system.
- MCP server.
- Safe edit writes.
- Agent context capsules beyond a basic map-informed explanation.
- Node adapter runtime.
- Static export adapter.
- Migration tooling.
- Benchmark publishing, public comparisons, and performance claims.
- Implemented multi-app workspace builds, split-app mutation, and distributed cache behavior.
- Devtools dashboard.

## MVP Marketing App Fixture

The first `apps/www` fixture contains:

- `app/layout.tsx`
- `app/page.tsx`
- `app/about/page.tsx`
- `app/docs/page.tsx`
- `app/benchmarks/page.tsx`
- `app/examples/page.tsx`
- `app/roadmap/page.tsx`
- `components/Hero.tsx`
- `components/FeatureGrid.tsx`
- `components/SpeedPanel.tsx`
- `components/MapPreview.tsx`
- `components/ExampleCard.tsx`
- `lumina.config.ts`

The fixture proves route discovery, generated route/render/map artifacts, direct local import map edges, route-file update reporting, Lumina Map nodes and edges, `lumina inspect why`, minimal `lumina map affected --json`, `lumina bench --list --json`, `virtual:lumina/routes`, minimal dev-server SSR page rendering for static, dynamic, and catch-all page routes with route `params`, `searchParams`, not-found components, and error components, route-specific dev hydration bundle output, route-specific production hydration bundle output, browser-verified interactive dev and production root-route hydration, static build output, and static built-output serving through `@lumina/adapter-bun`. Static start tests prove built HTML can be served after source route files are removed, static HTML uses `Cache-Control: no-store`, route-specific client assets use immutable cache headers, malformed encoded asset paths return sanitized 400 responses, unknown routes return stable 404 HTML, and the adapter request path avoids compiler, map, agent, MCP, devtools, docs, and source-discovery imports. Separate fixture tests prove explicit `staticPage()` and `ssr()` render-mode extraction plus diagnostics for unsupported declarations. `examples/basic` is verified as the starter example through dev, build, start, generated artifact, and built-output HTTP tests. Broader example verification beyond the basic starter, production SSR/API serving, production 500 fixture coverage, and measured speed evidence remain required before MVP Alpha is ready.

## Verification Required Before Calling MVP Alpha Ready

- Fresh `bun run check` passes.
- MVP fixture tests prove route discovery, manifest output, map output, and inspect output.
- Generated JSON snapshots are deterministic.
- README, AGENTS, status, roadmap, getting started, examples, file conventions, and Lumina Map docs agree on MVP scope.
- Public docs do not claim future features exist.

## Out Of Scope

- Replacing long-term contracts with MVP-only contracts.
- Weakening documentation standards.
- Claiming implementation exists before code and tests prove it.
