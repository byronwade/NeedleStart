# Documentation Strategy Audit

Status: Draft.

Audience: maintainers, documentation contributors, AI agents.

This audit evaluates the NeedleStart documentation system against the goal of becoming a top-tier framework documentation experience. It is based on the current repository state and current public documentation patterns from leading framework and developer-tool projects.

Detailed research notes live in `docs/documentation-research.md`.
The full file-by-file improvement matrix lives in `docs/documentation-matrix.md`.

## 1. Executive Summary

NeedleStart already has unusually strong early architecture, risk, agent-safety, and product-positioning documentation. Its biggest gap is not depth of thought; it is information architecture for different audiences. Mature framework docs separate onboarding, guides, reference, concepts, examples, deployment, release, security, governance, and contributor workflows. NeedleStart now has initial lanes for those areas, but most are still planned reference homes.

The highest-impact move is to keep building a docs system where every feature has a status, a quick example, exact API/reference details, generated artifacts, agent notes, verification requirements, and out-of-scope boundaries.

## 2. Current Docs Strengths

- Clear product thesis: app-graph-native, SEO-first, React, human and AI agent collaboration.
- Strong architecture split between compiler intelligence and small runtime adapters.
- Explicit risk mitigation for semantic graphs, safe edits, MCP tools, and Bun adoption.
- Good agent workflow foundations in `AGENTS.md`, `docs/skills/`, and `docs/subagents/`.
- Repeated warnings against claiming implementation before it exists.
- Early acceptance demo and task backlog give contributors a concrete direction.

## 3. Current Docs Weaknesses

- Many public-framework docs homes were missing before this pass: status, governance, security, release, testing, CLI, config, routing, deployment, examples, compatibility, and benchmark methodology.
- Several docs are architecture-first and not yet beginner-first.
- Reference material is not yet split into exact command, config, helper, manifest, and file-convention pages.
- Website-readiness is early: most docs are repo planning docs rather than polished public website content.
- Contributor and maintainer processes need more explicit governance, release, security, and review paths.
- Machine-readable docs plans exist, but `docs-index.json`, `llms.txt`, and schema-versioned examples are not yet specified in one place.

## 4. Biggest Market Opportunities

- Own the app-graph-native docs category with first-class map, manifest, and agent-context references.
- Make AI-agent docs a product surface, not a side note.
- Make benchmark honesty a trust advantage by requiring raw data and methodology before performance claims.
- Publish migration and comparison docs that are frank about what NeedleStart does not replace.
- Turn generated app metadata into docs artifacts: `llms.txt`, `docs-index.json`, route context capsules, manifest references, and graph explanations.

## 5. Competitor Documentation Lessons

| Reference project | Docs strength | Docs weakness | What NeedleStart should learn | What NeedleStart should avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs) | Clear Getting Started, Guides, and API Reference lanes. | Large surface can be hard to scan across App/Pages history. | Use simple top-level lanes and exact API reference pages. | Letting historical modes make new users unsure which path to follow. |
| [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/) | Beginner-friendly tutorials, recipes, and contributor-friendly docs culture. | Some feature depth is spread across guide and reference pages. | Use recipes for task workflows and make docs contribution easy. | Hiding exact contracts inside prose guides only. |
| [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start/latest/docs/framework/react/overview) | Strong typed-router positioning and modern full-stack concepts. | Younger docs surface than mature frameworks. | Be explicit about app contracts and typed route graph. | Under-documenting deployment and operational details early. |
| [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/overview) | Excellent type-safety and route-as-contract framing. | Advanced concepts can feel dense for beginners. | Make route graph concepts precise and API-backed. | Making app-graph docs too abstract before examples exist. |
| [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) / [Remix](https://v2.remix.run/docs/guides/api-routes/) | Strong route-module mental model and open governance signal. | Transition history can confuse users about product boundaries. | Explain route modules and governance clearly. | Ambiguous migration/version messaging. |
| [Vite](https://vite.dev/config/) | Concise guide/config/reference split and exact config examples. | Not a full app framework, so app-level guidance is limited. | Keep config reference exact and compact. | Mixing framework vision into low-level reference pages. |
| [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit) | Detailed file conventions and routing reference. | Dense pages can overwhelm first-time users. | File conventions need their own exact page. | Making one page carry tutorial, concept, and API reference at once. |
| [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/docs/4.x/getting-started/introduction) | Strong directory-structure docs, deployment breadth, and convention clarity. | Module ecosystem can expand navigation quickly. | Document directory structure and adapters early. | Letting plugin/module growth obscure the core path. |
| [Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) | Product-oriented docs lanes: Start, Products, Build, Manage, Reference, Resources. | Very broad platform surface requires heavy navigation. | Segment audiences by job and product surface. | Over-broad navigation before the product exists. |
| [Stripe](https://docs.stripe.com/) and [Stripe API Reference](https://docs.stripe.com/api) | Deep API reference, quickstarts, versioning, sandbox/test-mode clarity. | Payment domain complexity requires many cross-links. | Treat APIs, versions, examples, and test modes as first-class. | Performance or safety claims without test environments and evidence. |
| [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs) and [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api) | Deployment docs connect guides, APIs, build output, and platform concepts. | Platform breadth can blur framework-neutral guidance. | Document adapter/build output contracts precisely. | Tying NeedleStart docs too tightly to one host. |
| [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/) | Clear governance questions and role framing. | General advice needs project-specific translation. | Define maintainer roles, escalation, and decision records. | Leaving governance implicit until conflict appears. |

See `docs/documentation-research.md` for project-by-project notes.

## 6. Audience Analysis

| Audience | What they need | Current state | Priority improvement |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| New users | Honest status, quick start, simple mental model. | Getting-started page now exists but is planned. | Add beginner tutorial once scaffold exists. |
| App developers | Routing, config, SEO, API, deployment, examples. | Reference homes now exist; implementation absent. | Fill guides as features land. |
| Framework contributors | Architecture, package map, tasks, tests. | Strong. | Add task-level acceptance criteria and testing docs. |
| Maintainers | Governance, release, security, review process. | Added initial governance/security/release homes. | Define maintainer roles before public launch. |
| AI agents | AGENTS, stable JSON, safe edit rules, package boundaries. | Strong early foundation. | Add machine-readable docs index plan and schemas. |
| Security reviewers | Threat model, high-risk areas, reporting path. | High-risk areas documented; policy added. | Add threat-model docs per high-risk feature. |
| Open source program reviewers | License, conduct, governance, security, contribution path. | License exists; conduct/governance/security added. | Add maintainer and release policy detail. |
| Future website visitors | Public positioning, examples, comparisons. | Early. | Build website content map and public docs readiness checks. |

## 7. Documentation Information Architecture Review

The desired IA is:

- Start Here: README, status, getting started, roadmap.
- Learn: guides, examples, file conventions, routing.
- Reference: CLI, config, APIs, manifests, generated files, adapters.
- Concepts: architecture, compiler IR, runtime, Needle Map, Agent Kernel, SEO, safe edits.
- Operations: deployment, testing, benchmarks, release, security, governance.
- Community: contributing, code of conduct, open source community, decisions.
- Agent Docs: AGENTS, skills, subagents, MCP, safe edit transactions, machine-readable outputs.

## 8. Website-Readiness Review

Current docs are useful as source material but not yet a complete public docs site. Public pages need frontmatter, audience labels, status labels, page descriptions, and a navigation map. `docs/public-docs.md` and `docs/website-content-map.md` should become the bridge from repo docs to website content.

## 9. Contributor-Readiness Review

Contributor direction is strong for architecture and Phase 1. Missing pieces are issue labels, review ownership, release expectations, and exact testing commands once packages exist.

## 10. Maintainer-Readiness Review

Maintainer docs need governance, release, security intake, decision records, and benchmark approval rules. This pass adds initial homes, but they need detail as implementation starts.

## 11. Agent-Readiness Review

Agent readiness is a differentiator. The docs already define stable JSON expectations, safe edit rules, graph edge requirements, and AI playbooks. The next step is to define `docs-index.json`, `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, and schema-versioned output examples.

## 12. Missing Docs

Before this pass, requested docs missing from the repo included code of conduct, governance, security policy, status, product strategy, open source community, CLI, config, routing, manifest contracts, deployment, testing, API routes, schema, cache, benchmarks, benchmark methodology, accessibility, public docs, website content map, comparisons, examples, compatibility, release, app graph visual, and prompts.

## 13. Duplicated Or Confusing Docs

- `docs/skills/` and `docs/subagents/` are the canonical AI collaboration playbooks; do not add root mirrors.
- Runtime package naming previously mixed `@needle/server-bun` and adapter packages; current docs now prefer adapter package names.

## 14. Docs That Should Be Split

- `README.md` should stay concise; deeper setup and status belong in `docs/getting-started.md` and `docs/status.md`.
- `docs/api-reference.md` should eventually split into `docs/cli.md`, `docs/config.md`, helper APIs, and manifest contracts.
- `docs/needle-map.md` may later split graph model, query API, contracts, and generated JSON reference.

## 15. Docs That Should Be Merged

- Keep AI collaboration playbooks in `docs/skills/` and `docs/subagents/`; link them from root docs instead of duplicating them at the repository root.
- Benchmark content should eventually merge around methodology plus raw-results folders rather than scattered claims.

## 16. Docs That Need Diagrams

- Compiler pipeline.
- Request lifecycle.
- Generated artifact flow.
- Needle Map layered extraction.
- Safe edit transaction lifecycle.
- MCP read/write safety path.
- Adapter build output path.

## 17. Docs That Need Examples

- `needle.config.ts`.
- File-based routing.
- Metadata and SEO.
- API routes.
- Hot API routes.
- Needle Map query output.
- Agent context capsules.
- Safe edit transaction JSON.
- Adapter manifest.

## 18. Docs That Need Status Warnings

All planned feature docs should carry status warnings until code exists. This includes CLI, config, routing, deployment, API routes, schema, cache, MCP, safe edits, and benchmarks.

## 19. Docs That Need Better Cross-Links

- README should link status, getting started, guides, reference, and governance/security before public launch.
- Docs hub should remain the canonical navigation source.
- Architecture docs should link package map, compiler IR, runtime contract, and adapters.
- Safe edit docs should link MCP and Agent Kernel docs.
- Benchmark docs should link performance and methodology.

## 20. Highest-Impact Improvements

| Improvement | Impact | Effort | Urgency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keep docs status-aware with implemented/planned/scaffolded/verified labels. | High | Low | Immediate |
| Add missing governance/security/release/testing docs. | High | Medium | Immediate |
| Create exact CLI/config/routing/manifest references. | High | Medium | Phase 1 |
| Add machine-readable docs index and llms output plan. | High | Medium | Phase 1-2 |
| Add public website content map. | Medium | Low | Early docs foundation |
| Add benchmark methodology before any speed claims. | High | Low | Before benchmarks |
| Add examples once scaffold exists. | High | Medium | Phase 1-2 |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase A: Immediate Cleanup

Goal: make status, navigation, governance, and safety obvious.

Files: README, AGENTS, docs hub, status, governance, security, conduct, checklist.

Acceptance criteria: new contributor can identify current project status and next task without chat history.

Risks: adding too many placeholders. Keep each page explicit about planned status.

Verification: link check and status-language search.

### Phase B: Clarity And Linking

Goal: connect all existing architecture docs into beginner, contributor, maintainer, and agent paths.

Files: docs hub, getting started, guides, API reference, file conventions, package map.

Acceptance criteria: each major doc has audience, status, and related links.

Risks: duplicated content. Prefer links over repeated explanations.

Verification: docs hub review and local link checker.

### Phase C: Public Website Readiness

Goal: prepare docs to become website content.

Files: public docs, website content map, comparisons, examples, accessibility.

Acceptance criteria: public pages are status-aware and avoid unverified claims.

Risks: marketing hype before implementation. Keep vision separate from current behavior.

Verification: search for unsupported performance or implementation claims.

### Phase D: Contributor And Maintainer Polish

Goal: make open source operations credible.

Files: contributing, governance, release, security, testing, task templates.

Acceptance criteria: contributors know how to propose work; maintainers know how to review and release.

Risks: process overhead too early. Keep early governance lightweight.

Verification: dry-run a contributor path from README to task template.

### Phase E: AI-Agent And Machine-Readable Docs

Goal: make agent context exact and stable.

Files: AGENTS, agent kernel, MCP, safe edits, manifest contracts, docs index plan.

Acceptance criteria: every agent-facing output has schema-versioned JSON examples.

Risks: agents trusting planned behavior. Status labels must stay visible.

Verification: stable JSON examples and generated-file rules.

### Phase F: Examples, Benchmark, And Launch Docs

Goal: support credible adoption.

Files: examples, benchmarks, benchmark methodology, deployment, compatibility, comparisons.

Acceptance criteria: every benchmark claim links to raw data and methodology.

Risks: misleading comparisons. Compare specific workflows, not generic framework identity.

Verification: benchmark methodology checklist.

### Phase G: Long-Term Docs Maintenance System

Goal: prevent docs decay.

Files: docs maintenance checklist, PR templates, docs index, generated reference.

Acceptance criteria: feature changes update docs as part of definition of done.

Risks: manual sync burden. Generate docs where possible after packages exist.

Verification: CI docs checks once scaffold exists.

## Final PR Summary Draft

What changed:

- Added documentation strategy audit and competitor lessons.
- Added status, governance, security, code of conduct, and maintenance checklist scaffolds.
- Added public docs lanes for getting started, guides, API reference, and file conventions.
- Added Phase 1 build plan and adapter package clarification.

Why it matters:

- Contributors can understand the current state and next implementation path.
- Maintainers have governance and safety homes before public growth.
- AI agents have clearer routing to stable contracts and safe workflows.
- Future public website content has a source structure.

Audiences that benefit:

- New users, app developers, framework contributors, maintainers, AI agents, security reviewers, open source reviewers, and future website visitors.

Competitor lessons applied:

- Next.js-style getting started/guides/API reference lanes.
- Astro-style task guide culture.
- Vite-style precise config reference.
- Stripe-style API/reference and versioning discipline.
- Vercel-style build output and deployment contract thinking.
- Open source governance guidance from Open Source Guides.

Checks run:

- Local Markdown link check.
- `git diff --check`.

Checks not run at the time of this audit:

- `bun test` and `bun run typecheck`, because the repository had not scaffolded package scripts yet.

Current note: Phase 1 scaffold work has since added `bun test`, `bun run typecheck`, and the root `bun run check` gate. Treat this audit section as historical context, not current command status.

Remaining follow-up work:

- Fill each new reference home as implementation lands.
- Add docs frontmatter when the public docs site exists.
- Add PR templates and generated docs index.
- Add raw benchmark result storage once benchmark commands exist.
