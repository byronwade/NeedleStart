# Documentation Maintenance Checklist

Status: Planned.
Audience: maintainers, documentation contributors, AI agents.

Use this checklist before merging documentation, package, command, architecture, safety, or release changes.

Also apply `docs/docs-freshness-policy.md` for any change that can make docs stale.

## Always Check

- `README.md` still describes current status honestly.
- `AGENTS.md` still gives correct agent workflow and safety rules.
- `docs/status.md` matches the real project phase.
- `docs/README.md` links to any new durable docs.
- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` still reflects the required review gates.
- `docs/docs-freshness-policy.md` still reflects current docs freshness rules.
- `docs/docs-verification.md` still reflects the checks contributors are expected to run.
- `docs/testing-contract.md` still reflects test layers, fixture layout, snapshot policy, CI gates, browser artifacts, network rules, and evidence reporting.
- `docs/versioning-and-upgrades.md` still reflects public API, manifest, generated-file, compatibility, and release policy.
- `docs/diagnostics-contract.md` still reflects diagnostic codes, severity levels, source locations, remediations, docs links, JSON behavior, security rules, and fixtures.
- `docs/config-contract.md` still reflects config loading, validation, environment-variable, and normalized-output behavior.
- `docs/adapter-contract.md` still reflects adapter inputs, outputs, manifest fields, capabilities, static export behavior, environment variables, health endpoints, compatibility evidence, diagnostics, and fixtures.
- `docs/examples-contract.md` still reflects example statuses, README requirements, create-command integration, generated-artifact expectations, verification evidence, and public guide linking rules.
- `docs/routing-contract.md` still reflects route discovery, route IDs, sorting, diagnostics, manifest fields, and fixtures.
- `docs/api-route-contract.md` still reflects API handlers, method exports, request and response behavior, schemas, diagnostics, security rules, manifest fields, and fixtures.
- `docs/schema-contract.md` still reflects schema helpers, validation result shape, issue shape, query coercion, serializers, OpenAPI mapping, diagnostics, manifest fields, and fixtures.
- `docs/cache-contract.md` still reflects cache modes, headers, tags, revalidation, micro-cache behavior, diagnostics, security rules, manifest fields, and fixtures.
- `docs/seo-contract.md` still reflects metadata helpers, metadata merge behavior, sitemap output, robots output, structured data, diagnostics, security rules, SEO report fields, and fixtures.
- `docs/accessibility-contract.md` still reflects WCAG target language, semantic HTML, keyboard behavior, focus behavior, forms, diagnostics, public docs requirements, and test evidence.
- `docs/security-contract.md` still reflects high-risk surfaces, threat model rules, secret handling, production error behavior, security headers, agent/MCP write rules, vulnerability intake, supply-chain release rules, and evidence requirements.
- `docs/performance-contract.md` still reflects route budgets, Core Web Vitals target language, `.needle/perf.report.json`, performance diagnostics, benchmark evidence, and public speed-claim rules.
- `docs/speed-decisions.md` still reflects rendering defaults, build pipeline choices, runtime request path, React Compiler, React streaming, resource hints, fetch priority, speculation rules, bfcache, image/font delivery, compression, hot APIs, cache strategy, compiler scaling, rejected defaults, and benchmark positioning.
- `docs/speed-capability-audit.md` still maps every major speed surface to a decision, source docs, proof gate, and implementation follow-up.
- `docs/public-docs-site-architecture.md` still reflects public docs metadata, routing, navigation, and renderer decisions.
- Planned, scaffolded, implemented, and verified behavior are clearly separated.
- New examples are either verified or clearly marked as planned.
