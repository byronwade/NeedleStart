# Roadmap

Status: Scaffolded.
Audience: maintainers, framework contributors, AI agents.

NeedleStart should be built in phases. Each phase must define what it proves, what it implements, and what remains out of scope.

The first public prototype focuses on proving the agent-native and semantic graph wedge.

Unless a phase is explicitly marked `Verified.` or `Scaffolded.` with evidence, its "Definition of done" is planned acceptance criteria, not a claim that the behavior exists today. Future-phase acceptance bullets should use `should` wording when they describe behavior that does not exist yet.

## Major Milestones

### Foundation

- Monorepo, CLI skeleton, config, and AGENTS.md.
- Shared core data model.
- Route discovery and manifest generation.
- Basic Vite integration with React SSR and hydration.
- Nested layouts and params.

### Core Wedge

- Render modes: `staticPage()`, `prerender()`, `ssr()`, `stream()`, `clientOnly()`, ordinary API routes, and `apiHot()`, mapped to the shared `@needle/core` `RenderMode` literals.
- SEO engine: metadata, sitemap, robots, and audits.
- Adapter-aware Bun production output through `@needle/adapter-bun`.
- API routes and hot API compiler with schemas.
- Needle Map v1: file and import graph with affected queries.
- Agent context capsules and basic MCP read tools.
- Safe metadata edits with dry-run and affected checks.

### Advanced

- Needle Map v2 with semantic edges from contracts.
- Full Agent Kernel and write-capable MCP tools.
- Structured page DSL and content collections.
- Streaming SSR and experimental partial prerendering.
- Deployment adapters for static, Bun, Node, Docker, and later cloud targets.
- Devtools dashboard.
- Large-app support: ownership, boundaries, incremental builds.
- RSC experimental path, version-pinned and opt-in.

## Current Status

The repository is in Phase 1. The monorepo scaffold exists with Bun workspace configuration, package placeholders, shared core scaffold types, CI, and enforcement scripts. The next implementation stage is Phase 1A: expand and stabilize the shared core data model, then begin route discovery.

## How We Build

- Every major task uses a structured task template.
- Compiler and map are built as first-class systems from the beginning.
- Runtime stays minimal.
- Speed is treated as a whole-system property across compiler, runtime, client payload, graph queries, agent workflows, and benchmarks.
- All generated artifacts are explainable.
- NeedleStart should dogfood Needle Map and agent tools on the framework itself as soon as they exist.

## Phase 0: Project Constitution

Goal: define what the framework is and what it refuses to become.

Deliverables:

- `README.md`
- `VISION.md`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `docs/roadmap.md`
- `docs/compiler-ir.md`
- `docs/runtime-contract.md`
- `docs/agent-kernel.md`
- `docs/needle-map.md`

Definition of done:

- Project thesis is documented.
- Architecture principles are documented.
- Package responsibilities are documented.
- Agent rules are documented.
- Implementation task template exists.

Status: Verified.

Scope: complete for initial project constitution.

Risk mitigation focus:

- Lock the shared data model before implementation diverges.
- Keep the first working slice centered on compiler IR, route discovery, basic graph, SEO-safe rendering, and a low-risk safe edit.
- Keep speed strategy visible from the start: static-first output, build-time intelligence, small runtime adapters, compact JSON, and benchmark honesty.
- Treat `docs/risk-mitigation.md` as required reading for map, agent, MCP, adapter, and safe-edit work.

## Phase 1: Monorepo Skeleton

Goal: create the Bun workspace and package scaffolds.

Implementation guide: `docs/phase-1-build-plan.md`.

Status: Scaffolded.

Packages:

- `create-needle`
- `@needle/cli`
- `@needle/core`

- `@needle/react`
- `@needle/router`
- `@needle/seo`
- `@needle/map`
- `@needle/agent`
- `@needle/mcp`
- `@needle/cache`
- `@needle/schema`
- `@needle/devtools`
- `@needle/adapter-bun`
- `@needle/adapter-node`
- `@needle/adapter-static`

Definition of done:

- `bun install` works.
- `bun test` works.
- `bun run typecheck` works.
- `bun run docs:check` works.
- `bun run structure:check` works.
- `bun run performance:check` works.
- `bun run check` works.
- All packages have `package.json`.
- All packages expose `src/index.ts`.
- Placeholder tests exist.
- README, AGENTS, package map, and backlog reflect the implemented scaffold honestly.

Out of scope:

- Real route discovery.
- Runtime server.
- Vite integration.

## Phase 1A: Core Data Model

Goal: stabilize the shared immutable model in `@needle/core`.

The Phase 1 scaffold already exposes placeholder versions of these types. Phase 1A must turn them into contract-backed shapes instead of letting downstream packages invent local substitutes.

Required types:

- `NeedleApp`
- `RouteNode`
- `GraphEdge`
- `NeedleDiagnostic`
- `RenderMode`
- `CachePlan`
- `AdapterManifest`

Definition of done:

- CLI, compiler, map, agent, MCP, adapters, and devtools import shared types from `@needle/core`.
- `GraphEdge` includes `kind`, `source`, `confidence`, and `why`.
- Docs, type tests, and contract fixtures verify the type contracts.
- No package defines a competing local route or graph shape.

## Phase 2: CLI and App Discovery

Goal: discover routes from an `app/` directory and expose route inspection commands.

Commands:

- `needle routes`
- `needle inspect`

Route conventions:

```txt
app/page.tsx                       -> /
app/about/page.tsx                 -> /about
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx           -> /blog/:slug
app/docs/[...parts]/page.tsx       -> /docs/*
app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx   -> /pricing
app/api/health.ts                  -> /api/health
```

Definition of done:

- Routes are discovered deterministically.
- Dynamic params are parsed.
- Route groups do not affect URL paths.
- API and page routes are distinguished.
- Manifest is stable across operating systems.
- Tests cover nested routes, dynamic routes, catch-all routes, and route groups.

## Phase 3: Vite Integration

Goal: make a React app run in dev mode with Vite.

Deliverables:

- `@needle/vite-plugin`
- Virtual modules.
- Dev server middleware.
- Route manifest HMR.
- Client entry.
- Server entry.

Virtual modules:

```txt
virtual:needle/routes
virtual:needle/client-entry
virtual:needle/server-entry
virtual:needle/manifest
virtual:needle/head
```

Definition of done:

- `needle dev` should start Vite.
- Changing `app/page.tsx` should update browser output.
- `virtual:needle/routes` should work.
- React pages should render on the server.

## Phase 4: React Pages, Layouts, and Hydration

Goal: support familiar page and layout ergonomics.

Features:

- Root layout.
- Nested layouts.
- Route params.
- Search params.
- Error page.
- Not found page.
- Client components with `"use client"`.
- Basic hydration.

Definition of done:

- Nested layouts should render in correct order.
- Params should be available to page components.
- Search params should be available.
- 404 should use `app/not-found.tsx`.

- Hydration should work for simple client components.

## Phase 5: Render Modes

Goal: every route compiles into the fastest safe rendering strategy.

Public API:

```ts
export const render = staticPage()
export const render = prerender({ revalidate: "10m", tags: ["blog"] })
export const render = ssr({ cache: "no-store" })
export const render = stream()
export const render = clientOnly()
export const render = apiHot({ validate: true, serialize: "generated" })
```

Definition of done:

- Render mode should be detected.
- Static routes should emit `dist/public/*.html`.
- SSR routes should run through `@needle/adapter-bun`.

- `needle seo` should catch missing title, description, and canonical URL.
- `needle seo --json` should be stable for agents.
- Tests should cover static and dynamic metadata.

## Phase 7: Core Web Vitals and Performance Budgets

Goal: make performance visible and enforceable.

Phase boundary:

- Phases 0 through 7 should remain focused on compiler IR, route discovery, basic rendering, SEO, performance visibility, and the first graph foundation.
- Features that require major runtime complexity should be deferred unless they directly strengthen the map or agent demo.

Definition of done:

- Route JS and CSS sizes should be reported.
- Budgets should warn or fail according to config.
- Public page budgets should be stricter by default.
- JSON diagnostics should include safe suggestions.

## Phase 7A: Adapter Abstraction

Goal: create early adapter boundaries so Bun is the speed default but not an adoption blocker.

Packages:

- `@needle/adapter-bun`
- `@needle/adapter-node`
- `@needle/adapter-static`

Definition of done:

- `needle.config.ts` should support `runtime` and `adapter`.
- Generated server entry should import the selected adapter.
- Adapter manifest should document capabilities.
- User application code should not require Bun-only APIs.
- Static adapter should export static routes.
- Node adapter should serve a minimal SSR route.

- Dynamic API params should be implemented and tested.
- Plain objects should become JSON responses.
- Response objects should pass through untouched.

## Phase 10: Hot API Compiler

Goal: make selected API routes faster than generic framework handlers.

Definition of done:

- Params, query, and body schemas should validate.
- Response schema should serialize.
- Invalid input should return 400 with structured errors.
- Hot API routes should avoid generic JSON paths where possible.
- OpenAPI output should emit for API routes.

Goal: provide type-safe same-origin server calls.

Definition of done:

- Server functions should be callable from loaders.
- Server functions should be callable from client components through generated stubs.
- Input validation should work.
- Output validation should work in dev.
- Map should show which routes call each server function.

## Phase 13: Needle Map v1

Goal: build a file-level graph.

Risk mitigation focus:

- This is Layer 0 of semantic graph extraction.
- Use structured parsing plus deterministic import walking.
- Do not infer semantics beyond file-level relationships yet.
- Implement basic affected queries early because the graph is the product wedge.

Definition of done:

- Graph should include routes, components, APIs, schemas, tests, styles, and metadata.
- Affected query should connect changed files to impacted routes and tests.
- Explain query should include why edges exist.
- Output should be compact and deterministic.
- Tests should cover graph generation on fixture apps.

## Phase 14: Needle Map v2

Goal: move from imports into application meaning.

Risk mitigation focus:

- This is Layer 1 and Layer 2 of semantic graph extraction.
- Prefer explicit `.contract.ts` files as the primary source of semantic truth.
- Add convention-based inference only when the source and confidence are clear.
- Treat missing contracts as low-confidence graph data rather than guessing.
- Every semantic edge must include `kind`, `source`, `confidence`, and `why`.

Definition of done:

- Map should distinguish hard and soft edges.
- Component contracts should create prop edges.
- Route metadata should create SEO edges.
- Cache tags should appear as nodes.
- Affected checks should be smarter than import traversal.
- Agents should be able to ask what else must change if a component changes.

## Phase 15: Agent Kernel v1

Goal: make the framework usable by AI agents without forcing them to read the whole repo.

Definition of done:

- App-local `AGENTS.md` should be generated with project commands and rules.
- Context capsules should be generated per route.
- Agent context command should return compact JSON.
- Agent plan should return deterministic task skeletons.
- Production builds should not include agent metadata.

## Phase 16: MCP Server

Goal: expose framework data and actions through structured tools.

Definition of done:

- `needle mcp` should start the server.
- MCP clients should list routes.
- MCP clients should inspect a route.
- MCP clients should get related files.
- MCP clients should run affected checks.
- Write tools should require safe-edit validation.
- Tools should return compact structured JSON.

## Phase 17: Safe Edit API

Goal: let agents change apps through guardrails.

Risk mitigation focus:

- Safe edits must be transactional.
- Edits must be AST-based, never string replacement.
- The first safe edit should be low risk: route metadata only.
- Each edit must support dry-run preview, affected checks, mutation logs, and undo.
- High-risk changes require explicit override.

Definition of done:

- Safe edits should update metadata.
- Safe edits should add route block placeholders.
- Safe edits should update component contracts.
- `SafeEditTransaction` shape should be implemented.
- Dry-runs should apply patches in memory.
- `.needle/mutations.json` should be append-only.
- Unsafe fields should be rejected.
- Mutation log should be written.
- Affected checks should run after edits.
- `needle edit undo` should roll back the last safe edit.

## Phase 18: Migration Prototype

Goal: reduce adoption friction through a constrained Next.js migration path.

Command:

- `needle migrate from-next`

Definition of done:

- App Router pages should be copied into NeedleStart route shape when compatible.
- Layouts should be preserved when compatible.
- Static metadata should be converted.
- Dynamic route segments should be mapped.
- Ambiguous semantics should generate `.contract.ts` stubs.
- Migration report should list skipped files and manual review items.

## Phase 19: Node Adapter Baseline

Goal: reduce Bun adoption friction before the broader deployment adapter phase.

Rationale:

- The Bun adapter remains the default production path because speed matters.
- User application code should not depend on Bun-only APIs.
- Teams that require Node should have a credible path early.

Definition of done:

- A basic Node adapter should serve built static routes.
- A basic Node adapter should serve SSR routes.
- Adapter capabilities should be documented in `dist/adapter.manifest.json`.
- README should document Bun default plus Node compatibility.
- Benchmarks should distinguish Bun performance from Node compatibility.
