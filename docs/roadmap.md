# Roadmap

NeedleStart should be built in phases. Each phase must define what it proves, what it implements, what must be tested, and what remains out of scope.

The first public prototype focuses on proving the agent-native and semantic graph wedge.

Use `docs/status.md` as the current implementation truth table. Unless that file marks a command or feature implemented or verified, the behavior is planned.

## Major Milestones

### Foundation

- Monorepo, CLI skeleton, config, and AGENTS.md.
- Shared core data model.
- Adapter package baseline for Bun, Node, and static output.
- Route discovery and manifest generation.
- Basic Vite integration with React SSR and hydration.
- Nested layouts and params.

### Core Wedge

- Render modes: `staticPage`, `prerender`, `ssr`, and `apiHot`.
- SEO engine: metadata, sitemap, robots, and audits.
- Adapter-aware Bun production path.
- API routes and hot API compiler with schemas.
- Needle Map v1: file and import graph with affected queries.
- Agent context capsules and basic MCP read tools.
- Safe metadata edits with dry-run and affected checks.

### Advanced

- Needle Map v2 with semantic edges from contracts.
- Full Agent Kernel and write-capable MCP tools.
- Structured page DSL and content collections.
- Streaming SSR and experimental partial prerendering.
- Deployment adapters for static, Bun, Node, Docker, and later cloud targets.
- Devtools dashboard.
- Large-app support: ownership, boundaries, incremental builds.
- RSC experimental path, version-pinned and opt-in.

## Current Status

The repository is in Phase 0. The next implementation stage is Phase 1: monorepo skeleton, followed by core data model, adapter package baseline, and route discovery.

## How We Build

- Every major task uses a structured task template.
- Compiler and map are built as first-class systems from the beginning.
- Runtime adapters stay minimal.
- All generated artifacts are explainable.
- CLI and MCP JSON output must be stable and schema-versioned.
- NeedleStart should dogfood Needle Map and agent tools on the framework itself as soon as they exist.

## Phase 0: Project Constitution

Goal: define what the framework is, what it refuses to become, and the contracts implementation must follow.

Deliverables:

Public API:

```ts
export const render = staticPage()
export const render = prerender({ revalidate: "10m", tags: ["blog"] })
export const render = ssr({ cache: "no-store" })
export const render = stream()
export const render = clientOnly()
export const render = apiHot({ validate: true, serialize: "generated" })
```

Definition of done:

Goal: make performance visible and enforceable.

Definition of done:

- Route JS and CSS sizes are reported.
- Budgets can warn or fail.
- Public page budgets are stricter by default.
- JSON diagnostics include safe suggestions.

Phase boundary:

- Phases 0 through 7 should remain focused on compiler IR, route discovery, basic rendering, SEO, performance visibility, and the first graph foundation.
- Features that require major runtime complexity should be deferred unless they directly strengthen the map or agent demo.

## Phase 7A: Adapter Abstraction

Goal: make generated server output adapter-aware.

Definition of done:

- `needle.config.ts` supports `runtime` and `adapter`.
- Generated server entry imports the selected adapter.
- Adapter manifest documents capabilities.
- User application code does not require Bun-only APIs.
- Static adapter can export static routes.
- Node adapter can serve a minimal SSR route.

## Phase 8: Bun Adapter Production Server

Goal: ship a Bun adapter that serves static, SSR, and API routes from generated output.

Definition of done:

- `needle build` emits a runnable server bundle.
- `needle start` serves static pages through `@needle/adapter-bun`.
- `needle start` serves SSR pages through `@needle/adapter-bun`.
- 404 and 500 work.
- Cache headers are correct for static assets.
- Integration tests make HTTP requests and assert responses.
- Bun-specific APIs stay inside `@needle/adapter-bun`.

## Phase 9: API Routes

Goal: support full-stack API routes.

Definition of done:

- GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, OPTIONS, and HEAD work.
- Dynamic API params work.
- Plain objects become JSON responses.
- Response objects pass through untouched.
- Errors are formatted in dev and hidden in production.

## Phase 10: Hot API Compiler

Goal: make selected API routes faster than generic framework handlers.

Definition of done:

- Params, query, and body schemas validate.
- Response schema serializes.
- Invalid input returns 400 with structured errors.
- Hot API route avoids generic JSON path where possible.
- OpenAPI file emits for API routes.
- Benchmarks are reproducible.

## Phase 11: Cache System

Goal: build predictable and inspectable caching.

Definition of done:

- Route cache metadata appears in manifest.
- Cache tags are queryable by route and component.
- `revalidateTag` invalidates matching entries where the adapter supports it.
- Cache status appears in dev logs.
- Agent JSON output explains cache behavior.

## Phase 12: Server Functions

Goal: provide type-safe same-origin server calls.

Definition of done:

- Server functions callable from loaders.
- Server functions callable from client components through generated stubs.
- Input validation works.
- Output validation works in dev.
- Map shows which routes call each server function.

## Phase 13: Needle Map v1

Goal: build a file-level graph.

Risk mitigation focus:

- This is Layer 0 of semantic graph extraction.
- Use structured parsing plus deterministic import walking.
- Do not infer semantics beyond file-level relationships yet.
- Implement basic affected queries early because the graph is the product wedge.

Definition of done:

- Graph includes routes, components, APIs, schemas, tests, styles, and metadata.
- Affected query works from changed file to impacted routes and tests.
- Explain query includes why edges exist.
- Output is compact and deterministic.
- Tests cover graph generation on fixture apps.

## Phase 14: Needle Map v2

Goal: move from imports into application meaning.

Risk mitigation focus:

- This is Layer 1 and Layer 2 of semantic graph extraction.
- Prefer explicit `.contract.ts` files as the primary source of semantic truth.
- Add convention-based inference only when the source and confidence are clear.
- Treat missing contracts as low-confidence graph data rather than guessing.
- Every semantic edge must include `kind`, `source`, `confidence`, and `why`.

Definition of done:

- Map distinguishes hard and soft edges.
- Component contracts create prop edges.
- Route metadata creates SEO edges.
- Cache tags appear as nodes.
- Affected checks are smarter than import traversal.
- Agent can ask what else must change if a component changes.

## Phase 15: Agent Kernel v1

Goal: make the framework usable by AI agents without forcing them to read the whole repo.

Definition of done:

- `AGENTS.md` generated with project commands and rules.
- Context capsules generated per route.
- Agent context command returns compact JSON.
- Agent plan returns deterministic task skeletons.
- No production build includes agent metadata.

## Phase 16: MCP Server

Goal: expose framework data and actions through structured tools.

Definition of done:

- `needle mcp` starts server.
- MCP client can list routes.
- MCP client can inspect a route.
- MCP client can get related files.
- MCP client can run affected checks.
- Write tools require safe-edit validation.
- Tools return compact structured JSON.

## Phase 17: Safe Edit API

Goal: let agents change apps through guardrails.

Risk mitigation focus:

- Safe edits must be transactional.
- Edits must be AST-based, never string replacement.
- The first safe edit should be low risk: route metadata only.
- Each edit must support dry-run preview, affected checks, mutation logs, and undo.
- High-risk changes require explicit override.

Definition of done:

- Safe edit can update metadata.
- Safe edit can add route block placeholder.
- Safe edit can update component contract.
- `SafeEditTransaction` shape is implemented.
- Dry-run applies patches in memory.
- `.needle/mutations.json` is append-only.
- Unsafe fields are rejected.
- Mutation log is written.
- Affected checks run after edits.
- `needle edit undo` can roll back the last safe edit.

## Phase 18: Migration Prototype

Goal: reduce adoption friction through a constrained Next.js migration path.

Command:

```bash
needle migrate from-next
```

Definition of done:

- App Router pages can be copied into NeedleStart route shape when compatible.
- Layouts can be preserved when compatible.
- Static metadata can be converted.
- Dynamic route segments can be mapped.
- Ambiguous semantics generate `.contract.ts` stubs.
- Migration report lists skipped files and manual review items.

## Phase 19: Node Adapter Baseline

Goal: reduce Bun adoption friction before the broader deployment adapter phase.

Rationale:

- Bun remains the default runtime because speed matters.
- User application code should not depend on Bun-only APIs.
- Teams that require Node should have a credible path early.

Definition of done:

- A basic Node adapter can serve built static routes.
- A basic Node adapter can serve SSR routes.
- Adapter capabilities are documented in `adapter.manifest.json`.
- README documents Bun default plus Node compatibility.
- Benchmarks distinguish Bun performance from Node compatibility.

## Phase 20: Agent Simulator Harness

Goal: prove the agent and MCP workflow without calling an external LLM.

Definition of done:

- Fixture app includes safe and dangerous edit targets.
- Simulator can inspect routes through the same APIs MCP uses.
- Simulator can dry-run a metadata edit.
- Simulator can apply a metadata edit.
- Simulator runs affected checks.
- Simulator verifies mutation log output.
- Rejected edits are tested.
