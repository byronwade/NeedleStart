# Project Status

Status: Scaffolded.

Audience: maintainers, contributors, AI agents.

Lumina is in Phase 1: monorepo scaffold with route discovery, explicit static/SSR render-mode extraction, generated route/render/map artifacts, direct local import edges, route, inspect, and minimal map affected CLI paths, a minimal Vite dev-server path with timed human startup output, dynamic and catch-all page route params, search params, not-found/error components, and route-specific dev hydration bundles, browser-verified interactive dev and production root-route hydration, static build/start output with timed human build phases and route-specific production client bundles, and the early benchmark/status skeleton implemented.

## What Exists

- Product vision and positioning.
- Architecture and package-boundary plans.
- Roadmap and task backlog.
- Risk mitigation strategy.
- Documentation system scaffolding.
- AI skill and subagent playbooks.
- Alpha agent operating docs, work routing, drift-prevention rules, and tool-specific wrapper scaffolds for Claude, Codex, and Cursor.
- Prototype acceptance criteria.
- Bun workspace package scaffold.
- Root `package.json`, `bun.lockb`, `tsconfig.base.json`, and `tsconfig.json`.
- Package placeholders under `packages/` and `packages/adapters/`, except for the initial `@lumina/compiler` route-discovery API.
- Package manifests use `0.0.0` private scaffold placeholder versions; these are not published release versions.
- Contract-backed shared `@lumina/core` model types for routes, graph edges, diagnostics, cache plans, and adapter manifests.
- `@lumina/react` `staticPage()` and `ssr()` helpers for MVP render declarations.
- `@lumina/compiler` route discovery for page and API route files under `app/`, including deterministic route IDs, route groups, dynamic params, catch-all params, layout collection, duplicate-path diagnostics, explicit `staticPage()` / `ssr()` render-mode extraction, invalid/deferred render declaration diagnostics, MVP Bun `lumina.config.ts` parsing and diagnostics, compact `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, and `.lumina/map.json` generation with direct local import edges.
- `@lumina/map` minimal affected-route query support for map files generated from direct local import edges.
- `@lumina/cli` support for `routes <appPath> --json`, `inspect <appPath> --json`, `inspect <appPath> why <route>`, `map affected <appPath> <file> --json`, `bench --list --json`, `bench <name> --json`, `dev <appPath>` with timed human startup output, `build <appPath>` with timed human phase output, and `start <appPath>`, exposed locally through `bun run lumina -- ...`.
- `@lumina/vite-plugin` minimal dev-server and static-build integration that writes route/render/map artifacts, serves static, dynamic, and catch-all page routes with React SSR through Vite middleware, passes route `params` and `searchParams` to page components, renders nearest app-level or route-level not-found/error components for dev 404/500 responses, emits `.lumina/client/*.js` dev route hydration bundles, emits `dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js` production route hydration bundles, supports browser-verified interactive root-route hydration in dev and built output, exposes `virtual:lumina/routes`, and emits `.lumina/hmr-report.json` when app route files or direct local imported component files change.
- `@lumina/vite-plugin` static build integration that renders build-time static page routes into `dist/public`, writes `.lumina/generated/server-entry.ts`, copies deployment manifests into `dist/`, serializes normalized Bun config in `dist/adapter.manifest.json`, emits deterministic `apps/www` public docs preview artifacts at `dist/public/docs-index.json`, `dist/public/docs-navigation.json`, `dist/public/llms.txt`, and `dist/public/llms-full.txt`, and emits `.lumina/build-trace.json` plus `.lumina/perf.report.json` with initial status data.
- `@lumina/adapter-bun` static built-output serving for `dist/public` HTML with no source route files required on the request path, stable 404 behavior, tested static HTML, JSON, text, and client asset content/cache headers, a request-path import guardrail, and sanitized malformed-path responses.
- Scaffolded `apps/www` marketing app source with shadcn-style UI primitives, Tailwind v4/shadcn configuration files, light/dark theme tokens, a persisted theme toggle, a theme-aware graph relationship hero, a static public-docs route scaffold for the docs home plus start, concepts, guide, reference, deployment, and community pages, an in-app public-docs inventory sidebar grouped by lane, an SSR `/docs/search` route backed by a bundled public-docs index, an SSR `/docs/*` public-docs viewer backed by metadata and bundled Markdown body snapshots for the current `docs/public/` page set, verified starter example under `examples/basic/`, runnable content example under `examples/blog-seo/`, runnable generated large-route fixtures under `examples/large-100-routes/` and `examples/large-1000-routes/` for deterministic source generation, compact route/render/map artifacts, CLI JSON, and manifest-size readiness, and a scaffolded multi-app workspace example under `examples/multi-app-workspace/`.
- Early benchmark/status skeletons under `benchmarks/` and stable fixture placeholders under `fixtures/apps/`, all reporting `not implemented` and no synthetic timing results.
- CI workflow and root verification scripts for docs, structure, performance documentation, type checking, scaffold tests, shared core model tests, route-discovery fixture tests, and benchmark skeleton path/status tests.

## What Does Not Exist Yet

- Published packages.
- Released package versions.
- CLI implementation beyond `routes <appPath> --json`, `inspect <appPath> --json`, `inspect <appPath> why <route>`, `map affected <appPath> <file> --json`, `bench --list --json`, `bench <name> --json`, minimal `dev <appPath>`, static `build <appPath>`, and static `start <appPath>`.
- Measured benchmark results.
- SSR/API production build/start behavior.
- Runtime adapter behavior beyond static HTML serving through `@lumina/adapter-bun`.
- Broader component-level browser HMR beyond direct local import affected-route reports, production dynamic route SSR, and production not-found/error rendering.
- Compiler/build output beyond explicit static/SSR render-mode extraction, MVP Bun config normalization, `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json`, `.lumina/hmr-report.json`, `.lumina/generated/server-entry.ts`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, and initial `dist/*` deployment manifests.
- Lumina Map query modes beyond minimal `map affected`, semantic graph expansion, and affected-test accuracy beyond direct route impact.
- Agent Kernel implementation.
- MCP server.
- Safe edit transactions.
- Checked-in generated `.lumina/*` or `dist/*` artifacts.
- Generated docs sidebar artifacts, frontmatter parsing, generated per-document static public routes for every source Markdown file, and broader machine-readable docs outputs beyond the current `apps/www` preview artifacts.
- Implemented agent automation beyond documentation and wrapper scaffolds.

## Current Next Step

The next implementation path is completing component-level HMR and production hardening after the dev and production hydration proof. Phase 1A shared core model hardening is implemented in `@lumina/core` and covered by type-focused tests. Route discovery, explicit static/SSR render-mode extraction, MVP Bun `lumina.config.ts` parsing and diagnostics, `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json`, direct local import map edges, dynamic and catch-all page route params plus search params in the Vite dev server, dev not-found/error components, `.lumina/client/*.js` dev hydration bundles, `dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js` production hydration bundles, browser-verified interactive dev and production hydration, `.lumina/hmr-report.json` route-file and direct local imported component affected-route reports, `.lumina/generated/server-entry.ts`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, initial `dist/*` deployment manifests, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, minimal `lumina map affected --json`, `lumina bench --list --json`, `lumina bench <name> --json`, minimal `lumina dev` with timed human startup output, `virtual:lumina/routes`, static `lumina build` with timed human phase output, static `lumina start`, verified `examples/basic` dev/build/start evidence, runnable content example evidence, and generated large-route fixture source/artifact evidence are implemented and covered by fixture, artifact, CLI, HTTP dev-server, browser, and HTTP adapter tests. Static start tests now cover no-source request serving, cache headers for HTML and route client assets, request-path import guardrails, stable 404s, and sanitized malformed-path responses. The early benchmark/status skeleton paths exist with `not implemented` status and no benchmark evidence. MVP Alpha is not complete. The next prototype target is MVP Alpha, defined in `docs/mvp-alpha-scope.md`, and should stay focused on route discovery, basic render modes, generated route/render/map artifacts, CLI inspection, a demo app, and the first dev/build/start path. Agent workflow for that build target is scaffolded in `docs/alpha-agent-operating-system.md`, `docs/alpha-work-routing.md`, and `docs/alpha-drift-prevention.md`. See `docs/phase-1-build-plan.md`, `docs/large-repo-build-architecture.md`, and `docs/task-backlog.md`.

## MVP Alpha Target Status

MVP Alpha is planned, not complete. Route discovery, explicit static/SSR render-mode extraction, MVP Bun config parsing, route/render/map artifacts, direct local import map edges, dynamic and catch-all page route params plus search params in the Vite dev server, dev not-found/error components, `.lumina/client/*.js` dev hydration bundles, `dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js` production hydration bundles, browser-verified interactive dev and production hydration, `.lumina/hmr-report.json` route-file and direct local imported component affected-route reports, `.lumina/generated/server-entry.ts`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, minimal `lumina map affected --json`, `lumina bench --list --json`, `lumina bench <name> --json`, minimal `lumina dev` with timed human startup output, `virtual:lumina/routes`, static `lumina build` with timed human phase output, static `lumina start`, scaffolded `apps/www`, verified/runnable starter and content examples, and runnable generated large-route artifact fixtures exist, but the MVP build target still requires broader example verification and production API hardening.

Included MVP Alpha evidence should eventually cover `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json`, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, and the MVP Alpha demo app described in `docs/mvp-alpha-scope.md`.

## Status Language

Use these labels:

- Draft: exploratory design.
- Proposed: architecture decision proposed for planning, not proven by implementation.
- Planned: accepted target behavior, not implemented.
- Scaffolded: package or file exists, behavior is not complete.
- Implemented: behavior exists in code, current local evidence exists, and docs describe current behavior.
- Verified: behavior exists and the full required checks, fixtures, or evidence for that feature pass.
- Deprecated: behavior exists but should not be used for new work.

## Public Status Mapping

Internal Markdown docs use title-case labels with periods. Future public docs frontmatter uses lowercase values without periods.

| Internal status label | Public frontmatter value |
| --- | --- |
| `Draft.` | `draft` |
| `Proposed.` | `proposed` |
| `Planned.` | `planned` |
| `Scaffolded.` | `scaffolded` |
| `Implemented.` | `implemented` |
| `Verified.` | `verified` |
| `Deprecated.` | `deprecated` |
