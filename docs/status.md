# Project Status

This document is the single source of truth for what NeedleStart has planned, drafted, scaffolded, implemented, and verified.

NeedleStart is currently in Phase 0: project constitution. The repository contains planning and architecture documents, but no runtime implementation yet.

## Status Labels

Use these labels consistently across README, AGENTS, roadmap, package docs, and task plans.

| Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `planned` | The behavior is intended but no implementation exists. |
| `drafted` | The contract, public API, or architecture is described in docs. |
| `scaffolded` | Package/file structure exists, but behavior is placeholder or incomplete. |
| `implemented` | Code exists for the behavior. |
| `verified` | The documented command or behavior has been run successfully in this repository or a fixture app. |
| `deferred` | Intentionally out of scope for the current prototype. |
| `removed` | The idea was removed or superseded. |

A feature must not be marked `implemented` only because docs or task plans exist.

A command must not be marked `verified` until it has been run after the relevant package scaffolding exists.

## Update Rules

Update this file whenever one of these changes:

- A planned feature becomes scaffolded, implemented, verified, deferred, removed, or renamed.
- A command becomes runnable.
- A package is added, removed, or renamed.
- A generated artifact is added, removed, or versioned.
- A roadmap phase starts, completes, or changes scope.
- A governance artifact such as a template, workflow, CODEOWNERS entry, release policy, public docs policy, benchmark policy, or prompt changes status.

Every implementation PR should include a one-line status update when it changes the truth table.

## Verification Notes

When marking a command `verified`, include the date, environment, and fixture used in the relevant PR or release notes.

Example:

```txt
verified: 2026-07-05, macOS arm64, Bun 1.x, examples/basic
```

Do not encode machine-specific absolute paths in verified artifacts.

## Prototype Credibility Gate

The first public prototype becomes credible when the status matrix can honestly mark these as `verified`:

1. Create app.
2. Render React page.
3. Serve static route.
4. Serve SSR route.
5. Run API route.
6. Run hot API route.
7. Emit route manifest.
8. Emit render manifest.
9. Emit SEO report.
10. Emit Needle Map.
11. Emit route context capsule.
12. Start read-only MCP server.
13. Dry-run safe metadata edit.
14. Apply safe metadata edit.
15. Run affected checks.
16. Undo safe metadata edit.
17. Serve through Bun adapter.
18. Demonstrate Node/static adapter path as documented compatibility.
19. Generate public docs index or equivalent website-ready docs output.
20. Run benchmark smoke harness without publishing official performance claims.
