# File Conventions

Status: Planned.

This page documents the planned file and folder conventions for NeedleStart apps. These conventions are not implemented yet.

## Application Root

Planned files:

```txt
app/
needle.config.ts
package.json
public/
```

`app/` contains routes, layouts, API routes, metadata, and route-specific conventions.

## Pages

Planned page convention:

```txt
app/page.tsx
app/about/page.tsx
app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
```

Target route mapping:

| File | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `app/page.tsx` | `/` |
| `app/about/page.tsx` | `/about` |
| `app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx` | `/blog/:slug` |
| `app/docs/[...parts]/page.tsx` | `/docs/*` |
| `app/(marketing)/pricing/page.tsx` | `/pricing` |

Route groups in parentheses organize files without changing the URL path.

## Layouts

Planned layout convention:

```txt
app/layout.tsx
app/dashboard/layout.tsx
```

Layouts wrap nested pages in route order. The exact layout component contract will be documented after React rendering is implemented.

## API Routes

Planned API convention:

```txt
app/api/health.ts
app/api/users/[id].ts
```

Target route mapping:

| File | URL |
| --- | --- |
| `app/api/health.ts` | `/api/health` |
| `app/api/users/[id].ts` | `/api/users/:id` |

API files should export HTTP method handlers such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` once API routes are implemented.

## Render Mode Exports

Planned render mode export:

```ts
import { staticPage } from "needlestart"

export const render = staticPage()
```

Render modes should compile into the render manifest rather than being rediscovered at runtime.

## Metadata Exports

Planned metadata export:

```ts
import { defineMeta } from "needlestart"

export const meta = defineMeta({
  title: "Pricing",
  description: "Pricing for a NeedleStart app.",
  canonical: "/pricing",
})
```

Public pages should fail SEO checks when required metadata is missing once `needle seo` exists.

## Contract Files

Planned contract convention:

```txt
components/ProductCard.contract.ts
app/pricing/page.contract.ts
```

Contract files are planned as high-confidence semantic inputs for Needle Map. They should describe relationships that are too important for agents to infer from imports alone.

## Special Files

Planned special files:

| File | Status | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app/not-found.tsx` | Planned | Route-level or app-level 404 UI. |
| `app/error.tsx` | Planned | Route-level or app-level error UI. |
| `needle.config.ts` | Planned | Framework config. |
| `AGENTS.md` | Planned generated app artifact | Agent operating guide for a user app. |
| `llms.txt` | Planned generated app artifact | Compact AI-readable project summary. |
| `llms-full.txt` | Planned generated app artifact | Full AI-readable project context. |

## Generated Files

Generated files are planned under `.needle/` and `dist/`. They must not be edited manually.

See [API Reference](api-reference.md) for planned generated file responsibilities.

## Determinism Rules

When implemented, file convention output must:

- Normalize paths across operating systems.
- Sort routes deterministically.
- Ignore route groups in URL paths.
- Preserve enough source information for Needle Map and agent context.
- Emit helpful diagnostics for invalid or conflicting routes.
