# NeedleStart Subagents

Status: Scaffolded.
Audience: AI agents, maintainers, documentation contributors.

This directory defines vendor-neutral subagent role briefs for AI systems that support delegated or parallel work. They are documentation-only in Phase 1 scaffold and are intended to help agents from different AI companies coordinate consistently.

## Role Index

| Subagent | Best for | Must read |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`architect`](architect.md) | Architecture consistency and package boundaries. | `../../ARCHITECTURE.md`, `../package-map.md` |
| [`compiler-map`](compiler-map.md) | Compiler IR, route discovery, Needle Map, graph output. | `../compiler-ir.md`, `../needle-map.md`, `../risk-mitigation.md` |
| [`runtime-seo`](runtime-seo.md) | Runtime, rendering, SEO, adapters, performance. | `../runtime-contract.md`, `../seo-engine.md`, `../adapters.md` |
| [`agent-safety`](agent-safety.md) | Agent Kernel, MCP, safe edits, AI collaboration safety. | `../agent-kernel.md`, `../mcp-server.md`, `../safe-edit-transactions.md` |
| [`docs-keeper`](docs-keeper.md) | Documentation sync and status honesty. | `../../README.md`, `../../AGENTS.md`, `../README.md` |
| [`verification`](verification.md) | Checks, test planning, deterministic outputs. | `../../AGENTS.md`, relevant task docs |

## Delegation Rules

- Keep subagent tasks concrete, bounded, and non-overlapping.
- Give each subagent the exact files or area it owns.
- Tell subagents they are not alone in the codebase and must not revert unrelated work.
- Use these briefs as role contracts, not as a substitute for reading `../../AGENTS.md`.
- Subagents must report changed files, commands run, risks, and unresolved questions.
