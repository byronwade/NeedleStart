# Final PR Summary Draft

Status: Draft.

Audience: maintainers, reviewers, future PR author.

This is a ready-to-adapt PR summary for the documentation-system work.

## What Changed

- Added a documentation strategy audit with competitor lessons, audience analysis, final documentation architecture, implementation phases, and follow-up work.
- Added detailed research notes for leading framework and developer-tool docs.
- Added a doc-by-doc improvement matrix.
- Added a completion audit that maps requested deliverables to repository evidence.
- Added a documentation standard and maintenance checklist.
- Added a documentation verification runbook for repeatable docs checks and future CI scripts.
- Added a testing contract for test layers, fixture layout, snapshots, CI gates, browser artifacts, network rules, and evidence reporting.
- Added an adapter contract for Bun, Node, and static adapter inputs, outputs, manifests, capabilities, health endpoints, environment variables, compatibility evidence, and fixtures.
- Added an examples and templates contract for planned starter apps, status labels, README requirements, create-command integration, verification evidence, and public reference coverage.
- Added a Phase 1 build plan and status page.
- Added public-docs lanes for getting started, guides, API reference, file conventions, CLI, config, routing, manifests, examples, deployment, compatibility, security, release, benchmarks, and website readiness.
- Added machine-readable docs planning for `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, `docs-index.json`, and agent context outputs.
- Added planned contracts for CLI JSON, diagnostics, config loading, versioning/upgrades, public docs site architecture, product-build readiness, route discovery, API routes, schemas, cache behavior, and SEO behavior.
- Added accessibility contract docs for WCAG target language, semantic HTML, keyboard and focus behavior, form errors, diagnostics, public docs UI, and evidence requirements.
- Added security contract docs for high-risk surfaces, threat models, secret handling, production errors, security headers, agent/MCP writes, vulnerability intake, supply-chain release planning, and evidence requirements.
- Added performance contract docs for route budgets, Core Web Vitals targets, `.needle/perf.report.json`, diagnostics, benchmark evidence, lab-vs-field language, and public speed-claim rules.
- Added speed decision and capability audit docs for Vite/Rolldown, Bun, React Compiler, React streaming, resource hints, fetch priority, 103 Early Hints, speculation rules, bfcache, image/font delivery, compression, hot APIs, explicit caching, payload budgets, compiler scaling, rejected defaults, and benchmark gates.
- Added open source readiness docs: code of conduct, governance, security policy, maintainer guide, release process, and PR template.

## Why It Matters

NeedleStart is still documentation-only. This change makes the repository much easier to understand before implementation begins. It gives contributors a clean Phase 1 path, gives maintainers governance and review surfaces, gives AI agents structured rules and stable-contract expectations, and gives future public website content a source architecture.

## Audiences That Benefit

- New users: clearer status and target onboarding path.
- App developers: planned guide and reference lanes.
- Framework contributors: package, task, testing, and scaffold guidance.
- Maintainers: governance, release, security, benchmark, and review checklists.
- AI agents: AGENTS rules, safe edit rules, machine-readable docs plan, and prompt scaffolds.
- Security reviewers: high-risk area rules and threat-model expectations.
- Open source program reviewers: conduct, governance, security, release, and contribution docs.
- Future website visitors: public docs map and comparison principles.

## Competitor Lessons Applied

- Next.js: clear start/guides/API reference lanes.
- Astro: beginner-friendly task guides and docs contribution culture.
- TanStack: typed route/app-contract framing.
- React Router and Remix: route-module clarity and migration caution.
- Vite: concise config/reference style.
- SvelteKit, Nuxt, Astro, Hono, Zod, Valibot, Standard Schema, OpenAPI, TypeScript, Rust, ESLint, Rollup, Vite, Bun, Node, Vercel, Vitest, Playwright, Testing Library, Next.js, and Google Search Central: file conventions, route groups, dynamic segments, catch-all routes, endpoint conventions, validation, schema issue shapes, generated API docs, diagnostics, testing, adapter docs, deployment output, SEO metadata, sitemap, robots, and structured data rules.
- Supabase: audience and product-surface segmentation.
- Stripe: exact API reference, versioning, and test-mode discipline.
- Vercel: build output and deployment contract thinking.
- Next.js, Astro, and Vite: starter examples, project structure, recipes, and template-driven onboarding.
- W3C/WAI, MDN, and Next.js accessibility docs: WCAG target language, semantic HTML, keyboard/focus behavior, and lint/test evidence.
- OWASP, GitHub, and SLSA/OpenSSF docs: threat models, secret handling, production errors, security headers, private advisories, and package provenance planning.
- web.dev, Google Search, Chrome Lighthouse, Vite, React, Bun, MDN, and Vercel React performance guidance: Core Web Vitals targets, lab metric limits, performance budgets, variability, build-performance evidence, static-first routing, React Compiler caution, streaming only where useful, resource hints from known assets, fetch priority, 103 Early Hints, speculation rules, bfcache, image/font delivery, compression, waterfall avoidance, payload budgets, generated hot API paths, and no custom bundler until evidence requires it.
- Open Source Guides: governance and maintainer role clarity.

## Checks Run

- `git diff --check`
- Repository-wide local Markdown link check.
- Top-level `docs/*.md` docs-hub link coverage check.
- Documentation verification runbook review.

## Checks Not Run

- `bun test`
- `bun run typecheck`

Reason: the repository has no Bun workspace or package scaffold yet. The docs explicitly keep those commands marked as planned, not verified.

## Remaining Follow-Up Work

- Fill planned reference docs with exact API details as implementation lands.
- Add verified tutorials after the Phase 1 scaffold exists.
- Add generated `docs-index.json`, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt` once tooling exists.
- Add docs-site frontmatter after the docs site parser is chosen.
- Add raw benchmark result storage after benchmark commands exist.
- Keep `docs/skills/` and `docs/subagents/` as canonical and avoid root-level mirrors.
