# Cache

Status: Planned.

Audience: app developers, runtime contributors, AI agents.

NeedleStart caching must be explicit and inspectable.

The planned cache plan shape, HTTP header mapping, cache tags, revalidation behavior, diagnostics, manifest fields, security rules, and fixture requirements are defined in [Cache Contract](cache-contract.md).

## Principles

- No invisible caching.
- Every cacheable route, API, or generated artifact must expose its cache plan.
- Cache tags must be visible to Needle Map.
- Agent diagnostics must explain cache behavior.

## Planned Surfaces

- Route cache metadata.
- API response cache metadata.
- Hot API micro-cache.
- Cache tags.
- `revalidateTag`.
- Cache report in dev and JSON output.
- Cache diagnostics.
- Cache manifest fields.
- Public cache reference.

## Out Of Scope

- Invisible caching.
- Safety-critical decisions based only on inferred graph data.
- Distributed cache in the first cache system.
