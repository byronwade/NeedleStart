# Documentation Completion Audit

Status: Draft.

Audience: maintainers, reviewers, AI agents.

This document maps the documentation-system objective to current repository evidence. It is not a claim that Lumina implementation exists. It verifies that the documentation strategy, audit, scaffolding, governance, and maintenance artifacts requested for this documentation pass exist and are connected.

Coverage labels in the table below describe documentation coverage only. They do not describe implemented framework behavior, launch readiness, published package readiness, or benchmark evidence. When a row says planned documentation is covered, the matching framework behavior still requires implementation and verification before it can be marked implemented.

## Active Goal Completion Audit

This section maps the current active goal to repository evidence. It is a documentation-system completion audit; framework implementation remains Phase 1 scaffold with the first compiler route-discovery slice implemented.

| Active goal requirement | Current evidence | Judgment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Documentation is cohesive and uses consistent wording. | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/status.md`, `docs/documentation-standard.md`, `docs/docs-verification.md`, `docs/agent-enforcement.md`, and `scripts/check-docs.ts` define and enforce the shared identity, status labels, command terminology, generated-artifact vocabulary, public docs lanes, and current-vs-planned language. | Covered for current docs system |
| Features are consistent across docs and do not contradict current implementation status. | Root and public docs describe Phase 1 scaffold as Bun workspace, package placeholders, shared core types, route discovery, `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json`, `.lumina/hmr-report.json`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, minimal `lumina dev`, `virtual:lumina/routes`, static `lumina build`, static `lumina start`, CI, and enforcement scripts. They keep SSR/API production behavior, client hydration, component-level HMR, Lumina Map query CLI, MCP tools, and safe edits marked planned. `bun run docs:check` rejects known stale pre-scaffold and unimplemented-behavior wording. | Covered for current docs system |
| CLI and example references stay honest before implementation exists. | `docs/cli.md`, `docs/public/reference/cli.md`, `docs/examples-contract.md`, `docs/examples-catalog.md`, and `docs/public/reference/examples.md` mark `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, and minimal `lumina dev` as implemented and keep other command behavior and examples planned. `scripts/check-docs.ts` rejects ambiguous CLI headings that blur implemented and planned command surfaces. | Covered |
| Performance and speed docs stay evidence-aware. | `docs/speed-strategy.md`, `docs/speed-decisions.md`, `docs/speed-capability-audit.md`, `docs/performance-contract.md`, `docs/benchmark-methodology.md`, `docs/benchmark-fixtures.md`, `docs/checklists/performance-evidence.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and `scripts/check-performance-docs.ts` require evidence before public speed claims and reject unsupported slogans, including `fastest safe rendering strategy`. | Covered for current docs system |
| Agent rules enforce docs, performance, structure, and safety. | `AGENTS.md`, `docs/agent-enforcement.md`, `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`, `docs/docs-freshness-policy.md`, `docs/review-checklist.md`, `scripts/check-docs.ts`, `scripts/check-structure.ts`, and `scripts/check-performance-docs.ts` map agent workflow rules to checks and forbid root `skills/` or `subagents/` mirrors. | Covered for current scaffold |
| Lumina rename is consistent across public-facing docs and scaffold contracts. | `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/status.md`, `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/lumina-map.md`, `docs/public/`, `package.json`, `packages/**/package.json`, `packages/core/src/index.ts`, and `tests/scaffold.test.ts` use Lumina, `@lumina/*`, `create-lumina`, `lumina ...`, `lumina.config.ts`, `.lumina/*`, `lumina://`, `LuminaApp`, and `LuminaDiagnostic`. | Covered for current docs system |
| Public-facing Markdown files exist for a future advanced docs site. | `docs/public/README.md`, `docs/public-docs.md`, `docs/public-docs-site-architecture.md`, `docs/public-frontmatter-standard.md`, `docs/docs-site-build-plan.md`, `docs/website-content-map.md`, and the `docs/public/` tree define future website content, navigation, source mapping, public status rules, and docs-site implementation gates. | Covered as planned documentation |
| Docs are ready to guide prototype build work. | `docs/product-build-readiness.md`, `docs/phase-1-build-plan.md`, `docs/task-backlog.md`, `docs/package-map.md`, `docs/prototype-acceptance.md`, `docs/roadmap.md`, and feature contracts define the next path for client hydration, component-level HMR, and production hardening after the first static build/start slice, plus package boundaries, gates, acceptance criteria, risks, and evidence requirements without claiming broader behavior exists. | Covered for documentation readiness |
| Verification proves the current docs/scaffold gate. | Current required evidence is `bun run check`, which runs documentation checks, structure checks, performance documentation checks, TypeScript type checking, and scaffold tests. Goal closure must use a fresh passing run from the current commit. | Requires fresh run before closure |

## Verification Evidence

Current required verification for documentation-system changes:

- `git diff --check`
- `bun run docs:check`
- `bun run structure:check`
- `bun run performance:check`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test`
- `bun run check`

The root `bun run check` gate now runs documentation checks, structure checks, performance-documentation checks, TypeScript type checking, and tests. It verifies the current documentation, route discovery, generated manifest/map artifacts, route/inspect CLI paths, virtual route module behavior, route-file update reports, static build/start output, and minimal dev-server guardrails. It does not prove SSR/API production behavior, client hydration, component-level HMR, MCP tools, safe edits, or real benchmark results.

Manual review should still use `docs/docs-verification.md`, `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`, and `docs/documentation-standard.md` for claims, status labels, links, public-facing wording, and feature-surface consistency.

## Deferred By Design

These items are not completed as implemented framework behavior because the repository is in Phase 1 scaffold:

- Verified quick-start tutorial.
- Real CLI output.
- Real config defaults.
- Real route discovery behavior.
- Generated manifests.
- Generated `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, or `docs-index.json`.
- Real MCP tools.
- Safe edit implementation.
- Raw benchmark results.
- Published package release notes.

The documentation now contains homes, standards, and acceptance criteria for those items without claiming they exist.

## Documentation Coverage Judgment

The documentation-system deliverables requested in the audit brief are covered as repository documentation artifacts. Product implementation remains intentionally incomplete and status-labeled as planned until verified framework behavior exists.
