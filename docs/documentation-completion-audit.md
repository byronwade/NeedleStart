# Documentation Completion Audit

Status: Draft.

Audience: maintainers, reviewers, AI agents.

This document maps the documentation-system objective to current repository evidence. It is not a claim that NeedleStart implementation exists. It verifies that the documentation strategy, audit, scaffolding, governance, and maintenance artifacts requested for this documentation pass exist and are connected.

## Verification Evidence

Checks run during this documentation pass:

- `git diff --check`
- Repository-wide local Markdown link check.
- Documentation verification runbook review.
- Top-level `docs/*.md` hub-link coverage check.
- Required-file presence check for all files named in the objective.
- Required strategic-audit-section search.
- Documentation-standard coverage search.

Checks intentionally not run:

- `bun test`
- `bun run typecheck`

Reason: the repository has no Bun workspace or package scaffold yet. The docs explicitly mark these commands as planned and unverified.

## Deferred By Design

These items are not completed as implemented framework behavior because the repository is in Phase 1 scaffold:

- Verified quick-start tutorial.
- Real CLI output.
- Real config defaults.
- Real route discovery behavior.
- Generated manifests.
- Generated `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, or `docs-index.json`.
- Real MCP tools.
- Safe edit implementation.
- Raw benchmark results.
- Published package release notes.

The documentation now contains homes, standards, and acceptance criteria for those items without claiming they exist.

## Completion Judgment

The documentation-system deliverables requested in the audit brief are satisfied as repository documentation artifacts. Product implementation remains intentionally unimplemented and status-labeled as planned.
