# Documentation Completion Audit

Status: Draft.

Audience: maintainers, reviewers, AI agents.

This document maps the documentation-system objective to current repository evidence. It is not a claim that NeedleStart implementation exists. It verifies that the documentation strategy, audit, scaffolding, governance, and maintenance artifacts requested for this documentation pass exist and are connected.

Coverage labels in the table below describe documentation coverage only. They do not describe implemented framework behavior, launch readiness, published package readiness, or benchmark evidence. When a row says planned documentation is covered, the matching framework behavior still requires implementation and verification before it can be marked implemented.

## Verification Evidence

Current required verification for documentation-system changes:

- `git diff --check`
- `bun run docs:check`
- `bun run structure:check`
- `bun run performance:check`
- `bun run typecheck`
- `bun test`
- `bun run check`

The root `bun run check` gate now runs documentation checks, structure checks, performance-documentation checks, TypeScript type checking, and scaffold tests. It verifies the current documentation and scaffold guardrails. It does not prove runtime framework behavior such as route discovery, rendering, adapters, generated manifests, MCP tools, safe edits, or real benchmark results.

Manual review should still use `docs/docs-verification.md`, `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`, and `docs/documentation-standard.md` for claims, status labels, links, public-facing wording, and feature-surface consistency.

## Deferred By Design

These items are not completed as implemented framework behavior because the repository is in Phase 1 scaffold:

- Verified quick-start tutorial.
- Real CLI output.
- Real config defaults.
- Real route discovery behavior.
- Generated manifests.
- Generated `llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, or `docs-index.json`.
- Real MCP tools.
- Safe edit implementation.
- Raw benchmark results.
- Published package release notes.

The documentation now contains homes, standards, and acceptance criteria for those items without claiming they exist.

## Completion Judgment

The documentation-system deliverables requested in the audit brief are covered as repository documentation artifacts. Product implementation remains intentionally incomplete and status-labeled as planned until verified framework behavior exists.
