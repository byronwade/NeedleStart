# Speed Capability Audit

Status: Planned.

Audience: maintainers, framework contributors, performance reviewers, AI agents.

This audit checks whether Lumina has made explicit speed decisions for every major framework surface before implementation deepens. It is documentation evidence, not product benchmark evidence. The repository is in Phase 1 scaffold, so each framework behavior item below remains a planned decision with a proof gate.

## Research Baseline

This audit is based on current primary guidance and the repository contracts:

- [Vite performance](https://vite.dev/guide/performance), [Vite 8](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite8), [Vite 8.1](https://vite.dev/blog/announcing-vite8-1), [Vite build options](https://vite.dev/config/build-options), and [Vite Rolldown integration](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown) for dev/build speed, CSS splitting, source maps, and output controls.
- [React Compiler](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler), [React 19](https://react.dev/blog/2024/12/05/react-19), React streaming guidance, and React route-aware code-splitting guidance for rendering and client work.
- [Bun HTTP server](https://bun.com/docs/runtime/http/server) and adapter contracts for runtime speed.
- [web.dev Web Vitals](https://web.dev/articles/vitals), [web.dev INP](https://web.dev/articles/inp), [web.dev image performance](https://web.dev/learn/performance/image-performance), [web.dev font performance](https://web.dev/learn/performance/optimize-web-fonts), [web.dev resource hints](https://web.dev/learn/performance/resource-hints), and [web.dev bfcache](https://web.dev/articles/bfcache) for browser delivery and user experience.
- [MDN 103 Early Hints](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/103), [MDN fetchpriority](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Attributes/fetchpriority), [MDN speculative loading](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/Guides/Speculative_loading), [MDN Accept-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Encoding), and [MDN Content-Encoding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Encoding) for HTTP and browser hint behavior.

## Current Judgment

The documentation now covers the major speed decision surfaces as planned behavior. The largest remaining risk is not missing docs, but future implementation drift:

- Vite/Rolldown version choices must be refreshed before speed-sensitive implementation pins runtime or build dependencies; the 2026-07-06 snapshot points to current stable Vite 8.x/Rolldown.
- React Compiler must not become a default before fixtures prove compatibility.
- Browser-delivery optimizations must stay route-aware and budget-backed.
- Route code splitting, CSS splitting, source-map output, and telemetry must stay explicit defaults with fixture evidence before any exception.
- 103 Early Hints should be modeled as an adapter capability, not a universal default.
- Public speed claims must wait for raw data and comparable behavior.
- The early benchmark skeleton has landed before generated route artifacts, but skeleton files must not be treated as benchmark proof.

## Required Follow-Up At Implementation Time

After Phase 1 scaffold and before speed-sensitive implementation:

- Pin actual Vite/Rolldown/Bun/React versions in package docs and lockfile evidence after a fresh source check.
- Default to current stable Vite 8.x/Rolldown if scaffold work starts from the 2026-07-06 research snapshot and no blocking regression is found.
- Add fixtures that can later prove build speed, route discovery speed, and browser delivery behavior.
- Connect the early fixture and benchmark skeleton from `docs/implementation-speed-rules.md` to measured route-discovery and artifact-size work before publishing speed claims.

Before runtime/adapters are marked verified:

- Implement adapter capability flags for compression and 103 Early Hints from the planned contract fields.
- Prove Bun, Node, and static paths separately.
- Prove cache headers and compressed output with HTTP tests.

Before public performance claims:

- Run browser traces for LCP, INP, CLS, bfcache, and resource hints.
- Store raw benchmark results.
- Link claims to fixture source, methodology, and commit SHA.

## Out Of Scope

- Claiming any speed decision is implemented.
- Claiming Lumina beats another framework.
- Changing exact package versions without refreshing source evidence.
- Treating this audit as benchmark data.
