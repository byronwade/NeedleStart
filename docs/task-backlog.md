# Task Backlog

Status: Planned.
Audience: maintainers, framework contributors, AI agents.

This backlog turns the roadmap into concrete implementation tasks. Each task should eventually become an issue or implementation plan using `docs/templates/task-template.md`.

Unless a task is explicitly marked `Verified.` or `Scaffolded.` with evidence, its "Definition of done" is planned acceptance criteria, not a claim that the behavior exists today. Future implementation tasks should use `should` wording for behavior that does not exist yet.

Current implementation path: complete component-level HMR and production hardening after the dev and production hydration proof. Phase 1A shared core model hardening is implemented in `@lumina/core`; route discovery, explicit static/SSR render-mode extraction, `.lumina/routes.json`, `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, `.lumina/map.json`, dynamic and catch-all page route params plus search params in the Vite dev server, dev not-found/error components, `.lumina/client/*.js` dev hydration bundles, `dist/public/_lumina/client/*.js` production hydration bundles, browser-verified interactive dev and production hydration, `.lumina/hmr-report.json`, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, initial `dist/*` deployment manifests, `lumina routes --json`, `lumina inspect --json`, `lumina inspect why`, `lumina bench --list --json`, minimal `lumina dev`, `virtual:lumina/routes`, static `lumina build`, static `lumina start`, verified `examples/basic` dev/build/start evidence, and scaffolded app/example route evidence are implemented; the early benchmark/status skeleton exists with `not implemented` status and no public claims.

MVP Alpha implementation path: keep PR 1A through PR 4 focused on core model hardening, the early benchmark skeleton, large-repo architecture planning, route discovery, deterministic `.lumina/routes.json`, basic render mode data for `.lumina/render-manifest.json`, the first file-level `.lumina/map.json`, CLI inspection, and a demo app. API routes, MCP, safe edits, migration, Node adapter runtime behavior, benchmark publishing, and performance claims are post-MVP unless `docs/mvp-alpha-scope.md` changes in the same work.

## PR 0A: AI Collaboration Playbooks

Goal: maintain docs-level, vendor-neutral skill and subagent guidance for AI companies and human reviewers.

Task status: Scaffolded.

Evidence: documentation exists in `docs/skills/`, `docs/subagents/`, `docs/alpha-agent-operating-system.md`, `docs/alpha-work-routing.md`, `docs/alpha-implementation-sequence.md`, `docs/alpha-drift-prevention.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, `.agents/skills/`, and `.cursor/rules/`.

Definition of done:

- Skill index covers strategic app building, documentation maintenance, project maintenance, Lumina Map design, Agent Kernel design, SEO/runtime review, and MVP Alpha slice playbooks.
- Subagent index covers architecture, compiler/map, runtime/SEO, agent safety, documentation, verification, and MVP Alpha guardian roles.
- README.md, AGENTS.md, and docs hub link to the docs-level guidance and Alpha operating docs.
- Claude, Codex, and Cursor wrappers point back to vendor-neutral source docs.
- Guidance remains documentation-only until executable agent tooling exists.

## PR 0B: Documentation System

Goal: make the documentation structure comparable to a mature framework by separating getting started material, guides, API reference, file conventions, architecture, and contribution rules.

Task status: Planned.

Evidence: initial documentation structure exists in `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/guides.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/file-conventions.md`, `docs/documentation-standard.md`, `docs/documentation-audit.md`, and `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`.

Definition of done:

- Documentation hub clearly separates start-here, guide, reference, architecture, and contribution lanes.
- Every planned feature page uses clear status language.
- CLI, config, helper APIs, file conventions, generated files, and JSON outputs have reference homes.
- README links to the primary docs lanes.
- AGENTS.md tells future agents to follow the documentation standard.
- No page claims unimplemented commands or APIs work.

Remaining follow-up:

- Add verified tutorials after app creation and runtime behavior exist.
- Add public docs frontmatter after a docs site parser is chosen.
- Add generated `docs-index.json`, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt` plans to Agent Kernel implementation tasks.
- Keep the pull request template aligned with `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`, `docs/docs-verification.md`, and `docs/review-checklist.md`.
- Expand `docs/machine-readable-docs.md` into generated schemas when the owning packages have schema output behavior.
- Use `docs/templates/documentation-page-template.md` for new durable docs pages.
- Keep `docs/speed-strategy.md` current as performance, runtime, compiler, graph, agent, or benchmark plans change.
- Keep `docs/threat-model.md`, `docs/benchmark-fixtures.md`, `docs/examples-catalog.md`, and `docs/docs-site-build-plan.md` current as implementation begins.

- Speed coverage is audited in `docs/speed-capability-audit.md`, with each major speed surface mapped to its decision, source docs, proof gate, and implementation follow-up.
- Feature scheduling includes speed gates.
- Benchmark evidence rules link to `docs/benchmark-methodology.md`.
- Runtime and compiler docs link back to the speed strategy.
- No public speed claim is marked verified before benchmarks exist.

Remaining follow-up:

- Implement route asset metadata fields for scripts, styles, images, fonts, likely LCP assets, resource hints, compression eligibility, 103 Early Hints eligibility, and bfcache blockers.
- Implement adapter manifest delivery capability fields for compression, resource hints, 103 Early Hints, and bfcache-aware headers.
- Add fixtures that prove final `Link` headers, 103 Early Hints, compressed responses, and route delivery metadata match the same route asset evidence.
- Recheck current Vite sources before Phase 1 dependency pinning; the 2026-07-06 research snapshot points to current stable Vite 8.x/Rolldown as the scaffold default candidate.
- Add Bun native-route-dispatch fixtures before enabling `nativeRouteDispatch`, including parity against the generated matcher and timing evidence for `Bun.serve({ routes })`.

Goal: emit build, cache, HMR, generated artifact, and large-repo report artifacts without adding production payload by default.

Definition of done:

- `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/cache-report.json`, `.lumina/hmr-report.json`, and `.lumina/split-report.json` are documented.
- Reports avoid secrets, absolute local paths, random IDs, and machine-specific values unless marked raw benchmark data.
- Runtime adapters do not read these reports on the request path.

## PR 1J: Adapter Package Baseline

Goal: create early adapter package boundaries.

Definition of done:

- `@lumina/adapter-bun` package exists.
- `@lumina/adapter-node` package exists.
- `@lumina/adapter-static` package exists.
- Adapter capability type exists in `@lumina/core`.
- User-facing docs explain Bun default plus Node/static compatibility.

## PR 2: Route Discovery

Goal: discover `app/` routes and emit `.lumina/routes.json`.

MVP Alpha role: this is the first visible framework behavior. It should support the demo app routes listed in `docs/mvp-alpha-scope.md` before broader route conventions expand.

Task status: Implemented.

Evidence: `@lumina/compiler` exposes `discoverRoutes`, `createRoutesManifest`, and `writeRoutesManifest`; `.lumina/routes.json` is emitted as compact JSON; `@lumina/cli` exposes `routes <appPath> --json`; fixture coverage proves static routes, dynamic routes, catch-all routes, route groups, layout collection, API route distinction, deterministic manifest ordering, duplicate-path diagnostics, generated route artifacts, and JSON-only CLI output.

Read first:

- `docs/routing-contract.md`
- `docs/file-conventions.md`
- `docs/manifest-contracts.md`

Definition of done:

- Static routes work.
- Dynamic routes work.
- Catch-all routes work.
- Route groups are ignored in URLs.
- API routes are distinguished.
- Manifest order is deterministic.

## PR 3: Vite Dev Integration

Goal: make `lumina dev` start Vite and render a basic React page.

MVP Alpha role: start the demo app path and keep route/render/map artifacts inspectable without pulling API routes, MCP, safe edits, migration, or benchmarks into the first slice.

Task status: Scaffolded.

Evidence: `@lumina/vite-plugin` exposes `startLuminaDevServer`, `@lumina/cli` exposes `dev <appPath>`, and `tests/vite-dev-server.test.ts` covers SSR page serving, generated route/render/map artifacts, `virtual:lumina/routes`, route-file artifact regeneration with `.lumina/hmr-report.json`, Vite client passthrough, 404 behavior, and `--once` CLI smoke startup.

Definition of done:

- `lumina dev` starts.
- Page renders on the server.
- Client should hydrate.
- Component-level HMR should update changed pages without requiring a full reload.

## PR 4: React SSR and Hydration

Goal: support basic SSR and client hydration.

Task status: Implemented for root-route SSR, route-specific dev and production hydration bundles, and browser-verified interactive counter hydration in dev and built output; component-level HMR remains planned.

MVP Alpha role: prove the smallest render path needed for the demo app, with basic SSR and explicit render mode evidence only.

Definition of done:

- Root route SSR should work.
- Client component counter should hydrate.
- Dev errors should be readable.

## PR 5: Layouts and Params

Goal: support nested layouts, route params, and search params.

Task status: Scaffolded.

Evidence: nested layouts render through `@lumina/vite-plugin`, route discovery records dynamic and catch-all params, and `tests/vite-dev-server.test.ts` proves dynamic and catch-all page route params, search params, app-level/route-level not-found components, and app-level/route-level error components in the Vite dev server. Production SSR/API params and production special-file rendering remain planned.

Definition of done:

- Nested layouts render in order in the Vite dev server.
- Dynamic and catch-all params pass to pages in the Vite dev server.
- Search params pass to pages in the Vite dev server.
- 404 and error page conventions work in the Vite dev server.

## PR 6: Static Build

Goal: support `staticPage()` and emit static HTML.

Task status: Implemented for explicit `staticPage()` render declarations and build-time static page routes.

Evidence: `@lumina/react` exposes `staticPage()` / `ssr()` helpers, `@lumina/compiler` extracts explicit static/SSR render declarations with diagnostics for unsupported declarations, `@lumina/vite-plugin` exposes static build output, `@lumina/cli` exposes `build <appPath>`, `tests/render-mode-extraction.test.ts` covers explicit render modes, and `tests/static-build-and-start.test.ts` covers `apps/www` static HTML output, `.lumina/build-trace.json`, `.lumina/perf.report.json`, and deployment manifest copies under `dist/`.

Definition of done:

- Static routes should emit HTML.
- Render manifest should record mode.
- Invalid render exports should get helpful diagnostics.

## PR 7: Bun Adapter Production Output

Goal: support `lumina start` for built apps.

Task status: Implemented for static built-output serving.

Evidence: `@lumina/adapter-bun` exposes `startBuiltLuminaApp`, `@lumina/cli` exposes `start <appPath>`, and `tests/static-build-and-start.test.ts` proves static built HTML is served after source route files are removed, request-path imports stay generated-output only, static HTML uses `Cache-Control: no-store`, route-specific client bundles use immutable cache headers, malformed encoded asset paths return sanitized 400 HTML, missing routes return 404, and `start --once` smoke-starts and closes.

Read first:

- `docs/runtime-contract.md`
- `docs/cache-contract.md`

Definition of done:

- Static files are served for build-time static HTML routes.
- SSR routes should be served.
- 404 works for missing static routes.
- 500 should work.
- Basic HTML cache headers are tested for static built output.
- Bun serving is implemented through `@lumina/adapter-bun`.

Read first:

- `docs/schema-contract.md`
- `docs/api-route-contract.md`
- `docs/cache-contract.md`
- `docs/hot-api-path.md`
- `docs/benchmark-methodology.md`

Definition of done:

- Params should validate.
- Response should serialize.
- Invalid input should return structured 400.
- Benchmark fixture should compare normal and hot API.
