# Task Backlog

Status: Planned.
Audience: maintainers, framework contributors, AI agents.

This backlog turns the roadmap into concrete implementation tasks. Each task should eventually become an issue or implementation plan using `docs/templates/task-template.md`.

## PR 0A: AI Collaboration Playbooks

Goal: maintain docs-level, vendor-neutral skill and subagent guidance for AI companies and human reviewers.

Status: Planned.

Evidence: initial documentation exists in `docs/skills/` and `docs/subagents/`.

Definition of done:

- Skill index covers strategic app building, documentation maintenance, project maintenance, Needle Map design, Agent Kernel design, and SEO/runtime review.
- Subagent index covers architecture, compiler/map, runtime/SEO, agent safety, documentation, and verification roles.
- README.md, AGENTS.md, and docs hub link to the docs-level guidance.
- Guidance remains documentation-only until executable agent tooling exists.

## PR 0B: Documentation System

Goal: make the documentation structure comparable to a mature framework by separating getting started material, guides, API reference, file conventions, architecture, and contribution rules.

Status: Planned.

Evidence: initial documentation structure exists in `docs/getting-started.md`, `docs/guides.md`, `docs/api-reference.md`, `docs/file-conventions.md`, `docs/documentation-standard.md`, `docs/documentation-audit.md`, and `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`.

Definition of done:

- Documentation hub clearly separates start-here, guide, reference, architecture, and contribution lanes.
- Every planned feature page uses clear status language.
- CLI, config, helper APIs, file conventions, generated files, and JSON outputs have reference homes.
- README links to the primary docs lanes.
- AGENTS.md tells future agents to follow the documentation standard.
- No page claims unimplemented commands or APIs work.

Remaining follow-up:

- Add verified tutorials after app creation and runtime behavior exist.
- Add public docs frontmatter after a docs site parser is chosen.
- Add generated `docs-index.json`, `llms.txt`, and `llms-full.txt` plans to Agent Kernel implementation tasks.
- Keep the pull request template aligned with `docs/docs-maintenance-checklist.md`, `docs/docs-verification.md`, and `docs/review-checklist.md`.
- Expand `docs/machine-readable-docs.md` into generated schemas when the owning packages have schema output behavior.
- Use `docs/templates/documentation-page-template.md` for new durable docs pages.
- Keep `docs/speed-strategy.md` current as performance, runtime, compiler, graph, agent, or benchmark plans change.
- Keep `docs/threat-model.md`, `docs/benchmark-fixtures.md`, `docs/examples-catalog.md`, and `docs/docs-site-build-plan.md` current as implementation begins.

## PR 0C: Speed Strategy

Goal: define speed as a whole-system property before implementation begins.

- Speed coverage is audited in `docs/speed-capability-audit.md`, with each major speed surface mapped to its decision, source docs, proof gate, and implementation follow-up.
- Feature scheduling includes speed gates.
- Benchmark evidence rules link to `docs/benchmark-methodology.md`.
- Runtime and compiler docs link back to the speed strategy.
- No public speed claim is marked verified before benchmarks exist.

Remaining follow-up:

- Implement route asset metadata fields for scripts, styles, images, fonts, likely LCP assets, resource hints, compression eligibility, 103 Early Hints eligibility, and bfcache blockers.
- Implement adapter manifest delivery capability fields for compression, resource hints, 103 Early Hints, and bfcache-aware headers.
- Add fixtures that prove final `Link` headers, 103 Early Hints, compressed responses, and route delivery metadata match the same route asset evidence.
- Recheck current Vite sources before Phase 1 dependency pinning; the 2026-07-06 research snapshot points to current stable Vite 8.x/Rolldown as the scaffold default candidate.
- Add Bun native-route-dispatch fixtures before enabling `nativeRouteDispatch`, including parity against the generated matcher and timing evidence for `Bun.serve({ routes })`.
- Add route chunk, CSS chunk, source-map exposure, and no-default-telemetry fixtures before performance docs can be marked verified.
