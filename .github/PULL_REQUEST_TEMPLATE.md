## Safety And Evidence

- [ ] High-risk areas are called out.
- [ ] Threat note is included for high-risk implementation work.
- [ ] Security-sensitive changes include validation and review notes.
- [ ] Benchmark claims include raw data and methodology.
- [ ] Benchmark fixture name and raw result path are included when performance evidence changed.
- [ ] Speed-sensitive changes were checked against `docs/speed-strategy.md` and `docs/speed-decisions.md`.
- [ ] Test-sensitive changes were checked against `docs/testing-contract.md`.
- [ ] Agent-facing JSON changes are stable, compact, and schema-versioned where possible.
